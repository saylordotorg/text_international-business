    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_p01">In this chapter, you’ll learn the principles and techniques of global finance and accounting. In the opening case study, you’ll see the increased role that governments are playing in the business finance arena. In a flat world, access to capital (i.e., part of the finance function) is uniform across countries, as are accounting standards. However, access to capital varies significantly across countries and between small and large firms. Accounting standards also vary, though these differences are decreasing.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p01">Among the many changes taking place in the international business landscape, numerous leading management consultants predict that government will play an increasingly active role. Governments will no longer simply be an external regulator but will be a direct participant in particular strategic choices and actions. The <em class="emphasis">new normal</em>, in terms of government involvement in business, is one in which government’s hand in strategy and strategy execution will be highly visible and significant. Part of this governmental activism is a result of the growing scale and reach of global firms. For instance, even before the global financial meltdown in 2009, McKinsey &amp; Company consultancy noted the following:</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p02">As businesses expand their global reach, and as the economic demands on the environment intensify, the level of societal suspicion about big business is likely to increase. The tenets of current global business ideology—for example, shareholder value, free trade, intellectual-property rights, and profit repatriation—are not understood, let alone accepted, in many parts of the world. Scandals and environmental mishaps seem as inevitable as the likelihood that these incidents will be subsequently blown out of proportion, thereby fueling resentment and creating a political and regulatory backlash. This trend is not just of the past 5 years but of the past 250 years. The increasing pace and extent of global business, and the emergence of truly giant global corporations, will exacerbate the pressures over the next 10 years.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_001">Ian Davis and Elizabeth Stephenson, “Ten Trends to Watch in 2006,” <em class="emphasis">McKinsey Quarterly</em>, January 2006, accessed July 24, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Ten_trends_to_watch_in_2006_1734">https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Ten_trends_to_watch_in_2006_1734</a>.</span></p>

Its mining products are used for unearthing coal, gold, iron ore, oil sands, and other raw materials. The company sells products to customers worldwide, from large companies to small ones to quasi-governmental agencies operating largely in South America, Australia, Canada, China, India, South Africa, and the United States. Even though Bucyrus is a US-based company, international sales account for more than 70 percent of its revenues.</p>

        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p05">Like many successful multinationals, much of Bucyrus’s new work takes place in emerging markets where the growth and need is greatest. For instance, Bucyrus struck a deal in which its mining shovels would be used to dig coal to fire a giant, new power plant being built by Reliance Industries in India. Reliance, with nearly 25,000 employees, is India’s largest private-sector conglomerate, with business interests in energy, retailing, chemicals, textiles, and communications.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_004">“10 Years Highlight: Financial Highlights,” Reliance Industries Limited, accessed July 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ril.com/html/investor/10_yearshighlight.html">http://www.ril.com/html/investor/10_yearshighlight.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p06">Although Bucyrus and Reliance had agreed on the deal, the involvement of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) as a loan guarantor complicated things. Ex-Im Bank is the principal government agency responsible for aiding the export of American goods and services—thereby creating and sustaining US jobs—through a variety of loan, guarantee, and insurance programs. Although supporting US exports is its primary mission, the bank was sued by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and four American cities that brought a global warming lawsuit against the bank as well as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), contending that the agencies provided financial assistance to projects without first evaluating the projects’ global warming impacts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_005">Friends of the Earth, “Landmark Global Warming Lawsuit Settled,” press release, February 6, 2009, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://action.foe.org/t/6545/pressRelease.jsp?press_release_KEY=486">http://action.foe.org/t/6545/pressRelease.jsp?press_release_KEY=486</a>.</span> The lawsuit took seven years to resolve, but in the end the courts ruled that Ex-Im Bank and OPIC must consider the environmental effect of the projects they fund.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_006">“Settlement Agreement: Export-Import Bank of the United States,” Friends of the Earth, February 6, 2009, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.foe.org/pdf/Ex-Im_Settlement.pdf">http://www.foe.org/pdf/Ex-Im_Settlement.pdf</a>; “Victory!,” <em class="emphasis">ClimateLawsuit.org</em>, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.foe.org/climate/climatelawsuit/index.htm">http://www.foe.org/climate/climatelawsuit/index.htm</a>.</span></p>

It stated that the coal-fired power plant that would be fed by the mine conflicted with the Obama administration’s environmental goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_008">Mark Drajem, “Reliance Power’s India Plan Rejected by U.S. Export-Import Bank,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, June 26, 2010, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-26/reliance-power-s-india-plan-rejected-by-u-s-export-import-bank.html">http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-26/reliance-power-s-india-plan-rejected-by-u-s-export-import-bank.html</a>.</span> The guarantees would have backed loans that Reliance would have used to purchase mining equipment from Bucyrus.

Sullivan argued that the rejection could result in a loss of $600 million in equipment sales for Bucyrus and up to 1,000 US jobs could be at stake.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_010">Patrick McIlheran, “Reprieve for Bucyrus in Era of Mojo,” <em class="emphasis">Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel</em>, June 30, 2010, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/97521434.html">http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/97521434.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p08">Sullivan fumed at the bank’s rejection of his loan application. He had recently gone out on a limb and made the bold move of convincing his board of directors to spend $250 million to expand and refurbish Bucyrus’s South Milwaukee operations, while the company’s competitors were moving work to China.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_011">Rick Barrett, “Bucyrus Chief Dug Deep for Support,” <em class="emphasis">Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel</em>, July 3, 2010, accessed July 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/97745649.html">http://www.jsonline.com/business/97745649.html</a>.</span> Instead of accepting defeat with the bank’s decision, he went on the attack. Sullivan notified elected officials, many of whom were engaged in reelection campaigns. Given the prevailing tough US economic atmosphere, the officials would likely back an initiative that would retain or increase US jobs. Sullivan also called business and labor union leaders and enlisted support from Bucyrus’s hundreds of suppliers. The president of the United Steelworkers of America, Leo Gerard, appealed to the public to participate in a letter-writing campaign to protest Ex-Im Bank’s refusal to finance mining equipment that would be made by union members. “At a time when we are losing good-paying jobs, and at a time when President Obama wants to double US exports, how can the Export-Import Bank deny a loan that would create and protect jobs at Bucyrus International? It was a dumb decision,” Gerard told the <em class="emphasis">Journal Sentinel</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_012">Rick Barrett, “Obama Visit to Racine Wednesday May Be Pushing Review,” <em class="emphasis">Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel</em>, June 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/97319564.html">http://www.jsonline.com/business/97319564.html</a> accessed November 28, 2010.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p09">As Sullivan rallied potential supporters, luck played its role: President Barack Obama was planning for a town hall meeting in Racine, Wisconsin, just a few miles from Bucyrus’s headquarters. Even better, the town hall meeting topic was the economy. A local business association took out full-page advertisements in the local newspapers asking the president to help reverse the bank’s decision and save US jobs. Sullivan was astute in pushing the right political hot buttons, but getting Obama’s attention would have been much harder had he not been coming to Racine.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p10">It is important to remember that Bucyrus is not a coal miner but instead a supplier to that industry, so Ex-Im Bank’s complaint was really with Bucyrus’s customer, Reliance.
