Europeans sourced spices from China and India. The long overland trade routes required many payments to intermediaries and local rulers, raising prices of spices 1,000 percent by the end of the journey. Such a markup naturally spurred Europeans to look for other trade routes and sources of spices. The desire for spices and gold is what ultimately led Christopher Columbus to secure funding for his voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Even before that, Portuguese ships were sailing down the coast of Africa. In the 1480s, Portuguese ships were returning to Europe laden with African melegueta pepper. This pepper was inferior to the Far Eastern varieties, but it was much cheaper. By 1500, pepper prices dropped by 25 percent due to the new sources of supply.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_026">Edwin S. Hunt and James M.

But sourcing now is much more expanded; it includes the sourcing of components, of complete manufactured products, and of services as well.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Judging Quality from Afar: ISO 9000 Certification</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p01">How can companies know that the products or services they’re sourcing from a foreign country are of good quality? The mark of good quality around the world is ISO 9000 certification. In 1987, the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) developed uniform standards for quality guidelines. Prior to December 2000, three ISO standards were used: ISO 9001, ISO 9002, and ISO 9003. These standards were collectively referred to as ISO 9000. In 2000, the standards were merged into a revised ISO 9001 standard named ISO 9001:2000. In 2008, a new revision was issued, ISO 9001:2008. The standards are voluntary, but companies can demonstrate their compliance with the standard by passing certification. (Companies that had achieved ISO 9001:2000 certification were required to be recertified to meet ISO 9001:2008 standards.) The certification is a mark that the company’s products and services have met quality standards and that the company has quality management processes in place. Companies of any size can get certified. To ensure high-quality products, some companies require that their suppliers be certified before they will source products or services from them. ISO 9001:2008 certification is a “seal of quality” that is trusted around the world.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p02">In addition to quality standards, ISO also developed ISO 14000 standards, which focus on the environment. Specifically, ISO 14000 certification shows that the company works to minimize any harmful effects it may have on the environment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p03">Over the years, companies have learned to manage for quality and consistency.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Companies can use unannounced inspections to verify that their suppliers meet quality-assurance standards (although this is costly when suppliers are far away).</li>
                <li>For consistency, to avoid disruption in getting goods, Walmart makes sure that no supplier does more than 25 percent of their business with Walmart.</li>
                <li>Companies can evaluate supplier performance. Cost isn’t everything. Many companies use scorecards to evaluate suppliers from whom they source components. Cost is part of the scorecard, of course, but often it represents only part of the evaluation, not all of it. Instead, companies look at issues such as supply continuity, as well as whether the relationship is based on openness and trust.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s02_p01">One of the rising concerns about global sourcing is that of the carbon footprint of goods traveling long distances. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">carbon footprint</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of the impact that activities like transportation and manufacturing have on the environment, especially on climate change.

(The “footprint” is the impact, and “carbon” is shorthand for all the different greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_027">Mike Berners-Lee and Duncan Clark, “What Is a Carbon Footprint?,” <em class="emphasis">Green Living Blog</em>, <em class="emphasis">Guardian</em>, June 4, 2010, accessed September 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/jun/04/carbon-footprint-definition">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/jun/04/carbon-footprint-definition</a>.</span>) Everyone’s daily activities, such as using electricity or driving, have a carbon footprint because of the greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels for electricity, heating, transportation, and so on. The higher the carbon footprint, the worse the activity is for the environment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s02_p02">In global sourcing, although transporting goods by air and truck has a high carbon footprint due to the fossil fuels burned, ocean transport doesn’t. Also, the carbon-footprint measure doesn’t just focus on distance; it looks at all the fossil fuels used in the manufacture of an item. For example, when one looks at the total picture of how much energy is required to make a product, the carbon footprint of transportation may be less than the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process. Some regions have natural advantages. For example, it is more environmentally friendly to smelt aluminum in Iceland than locally because of the tremendous amount of electricity required for smelting. Iceland has abundant geothermal energy, which has no carbon footprint compared to generating electricity by burning coal. It’s better for the environment to smelt the aluminum in Iceland and then ship it elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s02_p03">Similarly, it is more environmentally sound for people in the United Kingdom to buy virgin wood from Sweden than to buy recycled paper made in the United Kingdom. Why? Sweden uses nuclear energy to make paper, which has a much lower carbon footprint than electricity in the United Kingdom, which is generated by burning coal. Even though the paper is recycled, the electricity costs of recycling make it more harmful to the environment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s02_s02_p04">Perhaps one of the most-effective changes companies can make to help the environment is to work collaboratively with their trading partners. For example, an agreement between potato-chip manufacturers and potato suppliers eliminated wasted resources. Specifically, the physics of frying potato chips requires boiling off the water in the potato, which consumes a large amount of energy. Although boiling off the water would seem to be a requirement in the cooking process, UK-based Carbon Trust discovered a man-made practice that increased these costs. Potato-chip manufacturers buy potatoes by weight. Potato suppliers, to get the most for their potatoes, soak the potatoes in water to boost their weight, thus adding unnecessary water that has to be boiled off. By changing the contracts so that suppliers are paid more for less-soggy potatoes, suppliers had an incentive to use less water, chip makers needed to expend less energy to boil off less water, and the environment benefited from less water and energy waste. These changes had a much more beneficial impact on the environment than would have been gained by a change in transportation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_028">MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics and Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, “Achieving the Energy-Efficient Supply Chain” (symposium, Royal Sonesta Hotel, Cambridge, MA, April 30, 2007).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s03_s01_p01">Although outsourcing’s costs savings, such as labor costs, are easy to see, some of the hidden costs aren’t as visible. For example, high-tech products that spend months traveling by ocean face product obsolescence, deterioration, spoilage, taxes, loss due to damage or theft, and increased administrative and business travel costs. Threats of terrorism, religious strife, changing governments, and failing economies are further issues of concern. Stanley Furniture, a US maker of home furnishings, decided to bring its offshore production back home after product recalls from cribs made in Slovenia, transportation costs, and intellectual property issues outweighed the advantages of cheap goods and labor.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_031">Sarah Kabourek, “Back in the USA,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, September 28, 2009, 30.</span> All of these hidden costs add up to a world that is less than flat.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s03_s03_s01_p02">Manufacturing outsourcing is also called contract manufacturing. The move to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract manufacturing</a><span class="glossdef">The outsourcing of manufacturing.</span></span> means that companies like IBM have less control over manufacturing than they did when they owned the factories. Contract-manufacturing companies such as Celestica are making IBM products alongside Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Dell products. Celestica’s own financial considerations influence whether it gives preference to IBM, HP, or Dell if there is a rush on manufacturing. The contract manufacturer’s best efforts will go to whichever client negotiated the best terms and highest price; this makes companies more vulnerable to variability.</p>
