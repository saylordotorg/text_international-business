        <h2 class="title editable block">What Talent Management Means</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s01_p01">You have likely heard the phrase “the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">war for talent</a><span class="glossdef">The competition between organizations to attract and retain the most able employees.</span></span>,” which reflects competition among organizations to attract and retain the most able employees. For years, agencies that track demographic trends have been warning that the US workforce will shrink in the second and third decades of the twenty-first century as the baby boom generation (those born between 1945 and 1961) reaches retirement age. According to one source, there will be 11.5 million more jobs than workers in the United States by 2010.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_040">“Extreme Talent Shortage Makes Competition Fierce for Key Jobs and Highlights Needs for Leadership Development,” <em class="emphasis">Business Wire</em>, November 26, 2007, 27.</span> Even though many boomers say they want (or have) to continue working past the traditional age of retirement, those who do retire or who leave decades-long careers to pursue “something I’ve always wanted to do” will force employers to scramble to replace well-trained, experienced workers. As workers compete for the most desirable jobs, employers will have to compete even more fiercely to find the right talent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s01_p02">Peter Cappelli of the Wharton School defines <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">talent management</a><span class="glossdef">Anticipating the need for human capital and setting a plan to meet it.</span></span> as anticipating the need for human capital and setting a plan to meet it. Talent management goes hand in hand with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">succession planning</a><span class="glossdef">A process whereby an organization ensures that employees are recruited and developed to fill each key role within the company.</span></span>, which refers to the process of recruiting and developing employees to ensure that the key roles in the company are filled.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_041">Peter Cappelli, “Talent Management for the Twenty-First Century,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 86, no. 3 (March 2008): 74–81.</span> Most companies, unfortunately, don’t plan ahead for the talent they need, which means that they face shortages of critical skills at some times and surpluses at other times. Other companies use outdated methods of succession planning that don’t accurately forecast the skills they’ll need in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s01_p03">Interestingly, however, techniques that were developed to achieve productivity breakthroughs in manufacturing can be applied to talent management. For example, it’s expensive to develop all talent internally; training people takes a long time and requires accurate predictions about which skills will be needed. Such predictions are increasingly difficult to make in our uncertain world. Therefore, rather than developing everyone internally, companies can hire from the outside when they need to tap specific skills. In manufacturing, this principle is known as “make or buy.” In human resources management (HRM), the solution is to make <em class="emphasis">and</em> buy—that is, to train some people and to hire others from the external marketplace. In this case, “making” an employee means hiring a person who doesn’t yet have all the needed skills to fulfill the role but who can be trained to develop them. The key to a successful “make” decision is to distinguish between the high-potential employees who don’t yet have the skills but who can learn them, from the mediocre employees who merely lack the skills. The “buy” decision means hiring an employee who has all the necessary skills and experience to fulfill the role from day one. The buy decision is useful when it’s too difficult to predict exactly which skills will be needed in the future.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_042">Patricia M.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s01_p04">One month after launching in Kenya, start-up txteagle became one of the country’s largest employers with a workforce of 10,000 Kenyans.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_043">Kate Greene, “Crowd-Sourcing the World,” <em class="emphasis">MIT Tech Review</em>, January 21, 2009, accessed January 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/business/21983">http://www.technologyreview.com/business/21983</a>.</span> Nathan Eagle founded txteagle in 2008. Txteagle deconstructs work into microtasks that can be performed on any simple mobile phone through texting. For example, one task is to type in local road signs (the data will be used to create a satellite navigation system).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_044">Robert Bain, “The Power of Text in the Developing World,” <em class="emphasis">Research</em>, January 20, 2011, accessed May 17, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.research-live.com/features/the-power-of-text-in-the-developing-world/4004395.article">http://www.research-live.com/features/the-power-of-text-in-the-developing-world/4004395.article</a>.</span> Txteagle is similar to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (mTurk), which also asks workers to complete microtasks such as clicking on photos that contain a particular object. The difference is that workers for txteagle only need a simple mobile phone—no computer or Internet access is necessary. Txteagle distributes the microtasks to thousands of workers (currently primarily in Africa) who complete them and get paid via the mobile phone either in airtime minutes or in cash through the M-Pesa service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_045">Andrea Meyer, “Workforce Innovation: How Txteagle Distributes Microtasks Worldwide,” <em class="emphasis">Working Knowledge</em> (blog), January 23, 2011, accessed January 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://workingknowledge.com/blog/?p=1444">http://workingknowledge.com/blog/?p=1444</a>; Jessica Vaughn, “Q&amp;A: Nathan Eagle, Founder of txteagle,” <em class="emphasis">JWT Intelligence</em>, March 3, 2010, accessed January 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jwtintelligence.com/2010/03/qa-nathan-eagle-founder-of-txteagle">http://www.jwtintelligence.com/2010/03/qa-nathan-eagle-founder-of-txteagle</a>.</span> “Txteagle is a commercial corporation that enables people to earn small amounts of money on their mobile phones by completing simple tasks for our corporate clients,” says Eagle.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_046">Jessica Vaughn, “Q&amp;A: Nathan Eagle, Founder of txteagle,” <em class="emphasis">JWT Intelligence</em>, March 3, 2010, accessed January 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jwtintelligence.com/2010/03/qa-nathan-eagle-founder-of-txteagle">http://www.jwtintelligence.com/2010/03/qa-nathan-eagle-founder-of-txteagle</a>.</span></p>

Companies like txteagle and mTurk give citizens in poor countries an opportunity to get work. But some Westerners criticize mTurk because employers can reject a person’s work without explanation. The pay scale is also very low—about twenty-four cents an hour, which makes some critics call mTurk a “digital sweatshop.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_049">Bryan Walsh, “Pennies for Your Thoughts,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, January 31, 2011, accessed January 31, 2011,<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043450,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043450,00.html</a>.</span> For workers in developing nations, however, where wages are low and unemployment rates are high, such wages may be better than the alternative of no work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s01_p06">Another principle from manufacturing that works well in talent management is to run smaller batch sizes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_050">Mason Carpenter, Talya Bauer, and Berrin Erdogan, <em class="emphasis">Principles of Management</em> (Nyack, NY: <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>, 2009), accessed January 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/printed-book/127834">http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/printed-book/127834</a>.</span> That is, rather than sending employees to three-year-long training programs, send them to shorter programs more frequently. With this approach, managers don’t have to make the training decision so far in advance. They can wait to decide exactly which skills employees will learn closer to the time the skill is needed, thereby ensuring that employees are trained on the skills they’ll actually use.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Attracting the Right Workers to the Organization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Winning the war for talent means more than simply attracting workers to your company. It means attracting the <em class="emphasis">right</em> workers—the ones who will be enthusiastic about their work. Enthusiasm for the job requires more than having a good attitude about receiving good pay and benefits—it means that an employee’s goals and aspirations also match those of the company. Therefore, it’s important to identify employees’ preferences and mutually assess how well they align with the company’s strategy. To do this, the organization must first be clear about the type of employee it wants. Companies already do this with customers—marketing executives identify specific segments of the universe of buyers to target for selling products. Red Bull, for example, targets college-age consumers, whereas Slim Fast goes for adults of all ages who are overweight. Both companies are selling beverages but to completely different consumer segments. Similarly, companies need to develop a profile of the type of workers they want to attract. Do you want entrepreneurial types who seek autonomy and continual learning, or do you want team players who enjoy collaboration, stability, and structure? Neither employee type is inherently “better,” but an employee who craves autonomy may feel constrained within the very same environment in which a team player would thrive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s02_p02">As stated earlier, it’s important to “mutually assess” how well employees’ preferences align with the company’s strategy. Half of “mutual” refers to the company, but the other half refers to the job candidate. Potential employees need to know whether they’ll fit into the company well. One way to help prospective hires make this determination is to describe to them the “signature experience” that sets your company apart. As Tamara Erickson and Lynda Gratton define it, your company’s signature experience is the distinctive practice that shows what it’s really like to work at your company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_051">Tamara J. Erickson and Lynda Gratton, “What It Means to Work Here,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 85, no. 3 (2007): 23–29.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s02_p03">Here are the signature experiences of two companies—Whole Foods Market and Goldman Sachs. At Whole Foods, team-based hiring is a signature experience—employees in each department vote on whether a new employee will be retained after a four-week trial period. This demonstrates to potential hires that Whole Foods is all about collaboration. In contrast, Goldman Sachs’s signature experience is multiple one-on-one interviews. The story often told to prospective hires is of the MBA student who went through sixty interviews before being hired. This story signals to new hires that they need to be comfortable meeting endless numbers of new people and building networks across the company. Those who enjoy meeting and being interviewed by so many diverse people are exactly the ones who will fit into Goldman’s culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s02_p04">The added benefit of hiring workers who match your organizational culture and are engaged in their work is that they will be less likely to leave your company just to get a higher salary.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Keeping Star Employees</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s03_p01">The war for talent stems from the approaching shortage of workers. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the millions of baby boomers reaching retirement age are leaving a gap in the US workforce. What’s more, workers are job-hopping more frequently than in the past. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average job tenure has dropped from fifteen years in 1980 to four years in 2007. As a manager, therefore, you need to give your employees reasons to stay with your company. One way to do this is to spend time talking with employees about their career goals. Listen to their likes and dislikes so that you can help them fully utilize the skills they like using or develop the new ones they wish to acquire.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_052">Beverly Kaye, <em class="emphasis">Love ’Em or Lose ’Em</em> (San Francisco: Barrett-Koehler, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s03_p02">Don’t be afraid to “grow” your employees. Some managers want to keep their employees in their department. They fear that helping employees grow on the job will mean that employees will outgrow their jobs and leave.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn12_053">Anne Field and Ken Gordon, “Do Your Stars See a Reason to Stay?,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Management Update</em> 13, no. 6 (2008), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/product/do-your-stars-see-a-reason-to-stay/an/U0806A-PDF-ENG">http://hbr.org/product/do-your-stars-see-a-reason-to-stay/an/U0806A-PDF-ENG</a>.</span> However, keeping your employees down is a sure way to lose them. What’s more, if you help your employees advance, it’ll be easier for you to move up, because your employees will be better able to take on the role you leave behind.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s03_p03">In some cases, your employees may not be sure what career path they want. As a manager, you can help them identify their goals by asking questions such as the following:</p>

Three talent-management practices, in particular, correlated highly with exceptional financial performance:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch12_s02_s04_p03">Let’s take a closer look at what each of these three best practices entail. First, having consistent talent evaluation means that employees around the world are evaluated on the same standards. This is important because it means that if an employee from one country transfers to another, his or her manager can be assured that the employee has been held to the same level of skills and standards. Second, having cultural diversity means having employees who learn something about the culture of different countries, not just acquire language skills. This helps bring about open-mindedness across cultures. Finally, developing global leaders means rotating employees through different cultures, giving them international experience. Companies that do this best also have policies of giving managers incentives to share their employees with other units.</p>
