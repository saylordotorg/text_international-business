        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s04_s01_p01">More and more firms—even very small ones—have operations that bridge national borders soon after their founding. Thanks to the Internet and related information technologies (IT) that enable many of them, this new breed of firms began emerging in the 1990s and is dubbed “born-global” because their operations often span the globe early in their existence. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">born-global firm</a><span class="glossdef">Also commonly called a global start-up, a business organization that, from inception, seeks to derive significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries.</span></span>, also commonly called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">global start-up</a><span class="glossdef">A business organization that, from inception, seeks to derive significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries.</span></span>, is “a business organization that, from inception, seeks to derive significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_051">Benjamin M. Oviatt and Patricia Phillips McDougall, “Toward a Theory of International New Ventures,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of International Business Studies</em>, First Quarter 1994, 47, accessed December 24, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://aib.msu.edu/awards/25_1_94_45.pdf">http://aib.msu.edu/awards/25_1_94_45.pdf</a>.</span> A common characteristic of such firms is that their offerings complement the products or capabilities of other global players, take advantage of global IT infrastructure, or otherwise tap into a demand for a product or service that at its core is somewhat uniform across national geographic markets. While many firms may fall into this category by virtue of their products, the operations and customers of born-global firms do actually span the globe—exploiting a combination of exporting and foreign direct investment.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s04_s01_p02">The born global firm is defined as a business organization that, from inception, seeks to derive significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries. In due course, these distinctive firms are gradually becoming the norm among companies that do international business. The distinguishing feature of born global firms is that their origins are international, as demonstrated by management’s global focus and the commitment of certain types of resources to international activities. Here we emphasize not the size, but rather the age by which the firm ventures into foreign markets. In contrast to the traditional pattern of businesses that operate in the home country for many years and gradually evolve into international trade, born globals begin with a “borderless” view of the world and develop the strategies needed to expand abroad at or soon after the firm’s founding. The focus is on the phenomenon of early internationalization and the approaches that companies leverage for achieving superior performance in international business from the inception of the firm.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_052">S.

The company’s operations and research and development were initially split between California and Switzerland, and then it expanded rapidly with production in Ireland and Taiwan. With its stylish and ergonomic products, Logitech captured 30 percent of the global computer mouse business by 1989, garnering the start-up a healthy $140 million in revenues.</p>

If you can answer yes to all or most of the questions from Phase 1, then you need to be sure that you can quickly build the resources and capabilities identified in Phase 2.

One reason is the increasing prevalence of global start-ups, driven in part by globalizing consumer preferences, mobile consumers, large global firms, and the pervasiveness of the Internet and its effects. The other is that global start-ups are very relevant to the subject of intrapreneurship, which you will learn about in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch03_s05#fwk-168388-ch03_s05">Section 11.5 "From Entrepreneurship to Intrapreneurship"</a>.</p>
