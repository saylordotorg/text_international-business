        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s04_s01_p01">The size of exports in the world grew from less than $100 million after World War II to well over $11 trillion today. Export and import is big business, but it isn’t just for big businesses. Most of the participants are small and midsize businesses, making this an exciting opportunity for entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s04_s01_p02">Importing and exporting require much <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">documentation</a><span class="glossdef">The official forms that must be presented to satisfy the import and export regulations of countries and for payment to be processed.</span></span> (i.e., filing official forms) to satisfy the regulations of countries. The value of the documentation is that it enables trade between entities who don’t know each other. The parties are able to trust each other because the documentation provides a common framework and process to ensure that each party will do what they say in the import/export transaction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s04_s01_p03">The main parties involved in export and import transactions are the exporter, the importer, and the carrier. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exporter</a><span class="glossdef">A person or organization that sells products and services in foreign countries that are sourced from the home country.</span></span> is the person or entity sending or transporting the goods out of the country. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">importer</a><span class="glossdef">A person or organization that sells products and services that are sourced from other countries.</span></span> is the person or entity buying or transporting goods from another country into the importer’s home country.

In the United States, the US Customs Service became the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The mandate now isn’t simply to move goods through customs quickly and efficiently to facilitate international trade; it also ensures that the items coming into the United States are validated and safe as well. Robert Bonner took the position as commissioner of the Customs Service on September 10, 2001. On his second day on the job at 10:05 a.m. EDT, he had to close all the airports, seaports, and border ports of entry. The priority mission of the Customs Service became security—preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country. On the third day, however, the trade and business implications of shutting down the borders became visible. Border crossings that used to take ten to twenty minutes were taking ten to twelve hours. Automobile plants in Detroit, using just-in-time delivery of parts for cars, began to shut down on September 14 due to a lack of incoming supplies and parts. Businesses were going to have a difficult time operating if the borders were closed. Thus, the twin goals of the newly created CBP became security as well as trade facilitation. As Bonner explained, “In the past, the United States had no way to detect weapons coming into our borders. We had built a global trading system that was fast and efficient, but that had no security measures.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_035">Robert Bonner, “Supply Chain Security: Government-Industry Partnership” (presentation at the Resilient and Secure Supply Chain symposium, MIT, Cambridge, MA, September 29, 2005).</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s04_s01_p07">The World Customs Organization (WCO) created a framework that calls for cooperation between the customs administrations of different countries. Under the WCO Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade, if a customs administration in one country identifies problems in cargo from another country, that customs administration could ask the exporting country to do an inspection before goods are shipped. Businesses across the world benefit (in terms of speed and cost) if there is one common set of security standards globally, and the WCO is working toward that goal.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_037">World Customs Organization, “WCO Presents Draft Framework of Standards at Consultative Session in Hong Kong, China,” news release, March 25, 2005, accessed September 7, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wcoomd.org/press/default.aspx?lid=1&amp;id=78">http://www.wcoomd.org/press/default.aspx?lid=1&amp;id=78</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch11_s04_s02_p01">In addition to the main players described above, intermediaries can get involved at the discretion of the importer or exporter.

A study of the speed and efficiency of items getting through customs in different countries found that it can take anywhere from three to twenty-one days to clear incoming goods. This variation causes problems because companies can’t plan on a steady flow of goods across the border. Some countries have customs idiosyncrasies. In Brazil, for example, no goods move within the country on soccer game days and documents that are not signed in blue ink will incur delays for their accompanying goods.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_039">“Supply Chain Strategies in Emerging Markets” (roundtable discussion at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, MIT, Cambridge, MA, March 7, 2007).</span></p>

For example, Eosta, an importer of organic fruit, puts a three-digit number on each piece of fruit. At the website <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.natureandmore.com">http://www.natureandmore.com</a>, customers can type in that number and get a profile of the farmer who grew the fruit, getting a glimpse into that farmer’s operations. For example, Fazenda Tamanduá, a farm in Brazil, grows mangoes using a variety that needs less water to grow and a drip-irrigation system that optimizes water use. This database gives customers a way to learn about growers and provides a way for growers and others to share what they learn.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn11_040">Daniel Goleman, <em class="emphasis">Ecological Intelligence</em> (New York: Crown Business, 2009), 191.</span> Providing this type of certification to customers differentiates Eosta products and makes them more attractive to sustainability-minded consumers.</p>

The importer promises to pay a specified amount of money when the bank receives documents about the shipment. Simply put, the letter of credit is like a loan against collateral (in this case, the goods being shipped) in which the funds are placed in an escrow account held by the bank. Letters of credit are trusted forms of payment in international trade because the bank promises to make the payment on behalf of the importer (i.e., buyer) and the bank is a trusted entity. Given that the letter of credit is like a loan, getting one issued from the bank requires proof of the importer’s (or buyer’s) ability to pay the amount of the loan.</p>
