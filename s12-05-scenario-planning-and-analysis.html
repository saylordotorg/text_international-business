In particular, you can use it to evaluate the implications of your industry analysis, both for your focal firm specifically and for the industry in general. However, a SWOT assessment works best with one situation or scenario and provides little direction when you’re uncertain about potential changes to critical features of the scenario. Scenario planning can help in these cases.</p>

You can also incorporate the results of scenario planning into your strategy formulation and implementation. Understanding the PESTEL conditions—as well as the level, pace, and drivers of industry globalization and the CAGE framework—will probably equip you with some insight into the outcomes of certain scenarios. The purpose of scenario planning, however, is to provide a bigger picture—one in which you can see specific trends and uncertainties. Developed in the 1950s at the global petroleum giant Shell, the technique is now regarded as a valuable tool for integrating changes and uncertainties in the external context into overall strategy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_051">Paul J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s01_p02">Unlike forecasts, scenarios are not straight-line, one-factor projections from present to future. Rather, they are complex, dynamic, interactive stories told from a future perspective. To develop useful scenarios, executives need a rich understanding of their industry along with broad knowledge of the diverse PESTEL and global conditions that are most likely to affect them. The six basic steps in scenario planning are detailed below.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s01_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Six Basic Steps of Scenario Planning</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Step 1.</strong> Choose the target issue, scope and time frame that the scenario will explore. The scope will depend on your level of analysis (i.e., industry, subindustry, or strategic group), the stage of planning, and the nature and degree of uncertainty and the rate of change. Generally, four scenarios are developed and summarized in a grid. The four scenarios reflect the extremes of possible worlds. To fully capture critical possibilities and contingencies, it may be desirable to develop a series of scenario sets.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Step 2.</strong> Brainstorm a set of key drivers and decision factors that influence the scenario. This could include social unrest, shifts in power, regulatory change, market or competitive change, and technology or infrastructure change. Other significant changes in external contexts, like natural disasters, might also be considered.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Step 3.</strong> Define the two dimensions of greatest uncertainty. (For an example, see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s02_t01">Table 8.4 "Developing Scenarios for the Global Credit-Union Industry"</a>.) These two dimensions form the axes of the scenario framework. These axes should represent two dimensions that provide the greatest uncertainty for the industry. For instance, the example on the global credit-union industry identifies changes in the playing field and technology as the two greatest areas of uncertainty up through the year 2005.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Step 4.</strong> Detail the four quadrants of the scenarios with stories. Describe how the four worlds would look in each scenario. It’s often useful to develop a catchy name for each world as a way to further develop its distinctive character. One of the worlds will likely represent a slightly future version of the status quo, while the others will be significant departures from it. As shown in the credit-union scenarios, <em class="emphasis">Chameleon</em> describes a world in which both the competitive playing field and technology undergo radical change, while <em class="emphasis">Wallet Wars</em> is an environment of intense competition but milder technological change. In contrast, in <em class="emphasis">Technocracy</em>, the radical changes are in technology, whereas in <em class="emphasis">Credit Union Power</em>, credit unions encounter only minor changes on either front.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_054">Adapted from “Scenarios for Credit Unions 2010: An Executive Report,” Credit Union Executives Society, 2004, accessed May 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dsicu.com/pdfs/2010_Scenarios.pdf">http://www.dsicu.com/pdfs/2010_Scenarios.pdf</a>.</span>
</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Step 5.</strong> Identify indicators that could signal which scenario is unfolding. These can either be trigger points that signal the change is taking place or milestones that mean the change is more likely. An indicator may be a large industry supplier like Microsoft picking up a particular but little-known technological standard.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Step 6.</strong> Assess the strategic implications of each scenario. Microscenarios may be developed to highlight and address business-unit-specific or industry-segment-specific issues. Consider needed variations in strategies, key success factors, and the development of a flexible, robust strategy that might work across several scenarios.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s01_p03">The process of developing scenarios and then conducting business according to the information that the scenarios reveal makes it easier to identify and challenge questionable assumptions. It also exposes areas of vulnerability (e.g., in a country, an industry, or a company), underscores the interplay of environmental factors and the impact of change, allows for robust planning and contingency preparation, and makes it possible to test and compare strategic options. Scenarios also help firms focus their attention on the trends and uncertainties that are likely to have the greatest potential impact on their future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s01_p04">Once you’ve determined your target issue, scope, and time frame, you can draw up a list of driving forces that is as complete as possible and is organized into relevant categories (e.g., science-technology, political-economic, regulatory, consumer-social, or industry-market). As you proceed, be sure to identify <em class="emphasis">key</em> driving forces—the ones with the greatest potential to affect the industry, subindustry, or strategic group in which you’re interested.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s05_s01_s02_p01">Among the driving forces for change, be sure to distinguish between <em class="emphasis">trends</em> and <em class="emphasis">uncertainties</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Trends</a><span class="glossdef">In the context of scenario planning, forces for change whose direction—and sometimes timing—can be predicted.</span></span> are forces for change whose direction—and sometimes timing—can be predicted. For example, experts can be reasonably confident in projecting the number of consumers in North America, Europe, and Japan who will be over sixty-five years old in the year 2020 because those people are alive now. If your firm targets these consumers, then the impact of this population growth will be significant to you; you may view it as a key trend. For other trends, you may know the direction but not the pace. China and India, for example, are experiencing a trend of economic growth, and many foreign investments depend on the course of infrastructure development and consumer-spending power in this enormous market. Unfortunately, the future pace of these changes is uncertain.</p>

But I came for a different type of big game. I was seeking out the successful enterprises that are identifying and capitalizing on the market opportunities, and seeking lessons from those that are not so successful, too. In Nairobi, Maserame Mouyeme of The Coca-Cola Company told me how important it is ‘to walk the market.’ Then, in Harare, I first heard the term ‘consumer safari’ in a meeting with Unilever executives. This is what they call their initiatives to spend a day with consumers in their homes to understand how they use products. Years after I started on this journey, I now had a term to describe the quest I was on. I was on a consumer safari. The market landscape that is Africa is every bit as marvelous and surprising as its geographic landscape.
