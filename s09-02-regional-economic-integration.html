        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Regional Economic Integration?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Regional economic integration has enabled countries to focus on issues that are relevant to their stage of development as well as encourage trade between neighbors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_p02">There are four main types of regional economic integration.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Free trade area.</strong> This is the most basic form of economic cooperation. Member countries remove all barriers to trade between themselves but are free to independently determine trade policies with nonmember nations. An example is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customs union.</strong> This type provides for economic cooperation as in a free-trade zone. Barriers to trade are removed between member countries. The primary difference from the free trade area is that members agree to treat trade with nonmember countries in a similar manner. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_012">Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf website, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/index.html">http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/index.html</a>.</span> is an example.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Common market.</strong> This type allows for the creation of economically integrated markets between member countries. Trade barriers are removed, as are any restrictions on the movement of labor and capital between member countries. Like customs unions, there is a common trade policy for trade with nonmember nations. The primary advantage to workers is that they no longer need a visa or work permit to work in another member country of a common market. An example is the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_013">Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa website, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.comesa.int">http://www.comesa.int</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Economic union.</strong> This type is created when countries enter into an economic agreement to remove barriers to trade and adopt common economic policies. An example is the European Union (EU).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_014">Europa, the Official Website of the European Union, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://europa.eu">http://europa.eu</a>.</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_p03">In the past decade, there has been an increase in these trading blocs with more than one hundred agreements in place and more in discussion. A trade bloc is basically a free-trade zone, or near-free-trade zone, formed by one or more tax, tariff, and trade agreements between two or more countries. Some trading blocs have resulted in agreements that have been more substantive than others in creating economic cooperation. Of course, there are pros and cons for creating regional agreements.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Pros</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">The pros of creating regional agreements include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trade creation.</strong> These agreements create more opportunities for countries to trade with one another by removing the barriers to trade and investment. Due to a reduction or removal of tariffs, cooperation results in cheaper prices for consumers in the bloc countries. Studies indicate that regional economic integration significantly contributes to the relatively high growth rates in the less-developed countries.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employment opportunities.</strong> By removing restrictions on labor movement, economic integration can help expand job opportunities.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consensus and cooperation.</strong> Member nations may find it easier to agree with smaller numbers of countries. Regional understanding and similarities may also facilitate closer political cooperation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Cons</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p01">The cons involved in creating regional agreements include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trade diversion.</strong> The flip side to trade creation is trade diversion. Member countries may trade more with each other than with nonmember nations. This may mean increased trade with a less efficient or more expensive producer because it is in a member country. In this sense, weaker companies can be protected inadvertently with the bloc agreement acting as a trade barrier. In essence, regional agreements have formed new trade barriers with countries outside of the trading bloc.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employment shifts and reductions.</strong> Countries may move production to cheaper labor markets in member countries. Similarly, workers may move to gain access to better jobs and wages. Sudden shifts in employment can tax the resources of member countries.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Loss of national sovereignty.</strong> With each new round of discussions and agreements within a regional bloc, nations may find that they have to give up more of their political and economic rights. In the opening case study, you learned how the economic crisis in Greece is threatening not only the EU in general but also the rights of Greece and other member nations to determine their own domestic economic policies.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Major Areas of Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_p01">There are more than one hundred regional trade agreements in place, a number that is continuously evolving as countries reconfigure their economic and political interests and priorities. Additionally, the expansion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has caused smaller regional agreements to become obsolete. Some of the regional blocs also created side agreements with other regional groups leading to a web of trade agreements and understandings.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">North America: NAFTA</h2>
            <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Brief History and Purpose</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into being during a period when free trade and trading blocs were popular and positively perceived. In 1988, the United States and Canada signed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement. Shortly after it was approved and implemented, the United States started to negotiate a similar agreement with Mexico. When Canada asked to be party to any negotiations to preserve its rights under the most-favored-nation clause (MFN), the negotiations began for NAFTA, which was finally signed in 1992 and implemented in 1994.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p02">The goal of NAFTA has been to encourage trade between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. By reducing tariffs and trade barriers, the countries hope to create a free-trade zone where companies can benefit from the transfer of goods. In the 1980s, Mexico had tariffs as high as 100 percent on select goods. Over the first decade of the agreement, almost all tariffs between Mexico, Canada, and the United States were phased out.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p03">The rules governing origin of content are key to NAFTA. As a free trade agreement, the member countries can establish their own trading rules for nonmember countries. NAFTA’s rules ensure that a foreign exporter won’t just ship to the NAFTA country with the lowest tariff for nonmember countries. NAFTA rules require that at least 50 percent of the net cost of most products must come from or be incurred in the NAFTA region. There are higher requirements for footwear and cars. For example, this origin of content rule has ensured that cheap Asian manufacturers wouldn’t negotiate lower tariffs with one NAFTA country, such as Mexico, and dump cheap products into Canada and the United States. Mexican <em class="emphasis">maquiladoras</em> have fared well in this arrangement by being the final production stop before entering the United States or Canada. <em class="emphasis">Maquiladoras</em> are production facilities located in border towns in Mexico that take imported materials and produce the finished good for export, primarily to Canada or the United States.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Current Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">Canadian and US consumers have benefited from the lower-cost Mexican agricultural products. Similarly, Canadian and US companies have sought to enter the expanding Mexican domestic market. Many Canadian and US companies have chosen to locate their manufacturing or production facilities in Mexico rather than Asia, which was geographically far from their North American bases.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s02_p02">When it was introduced, NAFTA was highly controversial, particularly in the United States, where many felt it would send US jobs to Mexico. In the long run, NAFTA hasn’t been as impactful as its supporters had hoped nor as detrimental to workers and companies as its critics had feared. As part of NAFTA, two side agreements addressing labor and environmental standards were put into place. The expectation was that these side agreements would ensure that Mexico had to move toward improving working conditions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s02_p03">Mexico has fared the best from NAFTA as trade has increased dramatically. <em class="emphasis">Maquiladoras</em> in Mexico have seen a 15 percent annual increase in income. By and large, Canadians have been supportive of NAFTA and exports to the region have increased in the period since implementation. “Tri-lateral [merchandise] trade has nearly tripled since NAFTA came into force in 1994. It topped $1 trillion in 2008.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_015">Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, “Fast Facts: North American Free Trade Agreement,” December 15, 2009, accessed December 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/nafta-alena/fast_facts-faits_saillants.aspx?lang=eng">http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/nafta-alena/fast_facts-faits_saillants.aspx?lang=eng</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">Given the 2008 global economic recession and challenging impact on the EU, it isn’t likely that NAFTA will move beyond the free-trade zone status to anything more comprehensive (e.g., the EU’s economic union). In the opening case study, you read about the pressures on the EU and the resistance by each of the governments in Europe to make policy adjustments to address the recession. The United States, as the largest country member in NAFTA, won’t give up its rights to independently determine its economic and trade policies. Observers note that there may be the opportunity for NAFTA to expand to include other countries in Latin America.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_016">William M.

                    <p class="simpara">Mexico, NAFTA, and the <em class="emphasis bolditalic">Maquiladoras</em></p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p02">The Mexican economy has undergone dramatic changes during the last decade and a half as the country has become integrated into the global marketplace. Once highly protected, Mexico is now open for business. Successive governments have instituted far-reaching economic reforms, which have had a major impact on the way business is conducted. The scale of business has changed as well. Forced to compete with large multinationals and Mexican conglomerates, many traditional family-owned firms have had to close because they were unable to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p03">NAFTA has added to the already-strong US influence on Mexico’s corporate and business practices. In particular, competitiveness and efficiency have become higher priorities, although company owners and managers still like to surround themselves with people they know and to groom their sons and sometimes their daughters to be their successors. US influence is also pervasive in the products and services offered throughout Mexico.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p04">Mexico has always had a strong entrepreneurial business culture, but until NAFTA, it was protected from the pressures of international finance and the global marketplace. Business and particularly interpersonal business relationships were viewed as something that should be pleasurable, like other important aspects of life.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p05">Long-term relationships are still the foundation on which trust is established and business is built. In Mexico, patience and the willingness to wait are still highly valued—and necessary—in business transactions. This is slowly changing, spurred in part by an aggressive cadre of young professionals who pursued graduate education in the United States.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p06">Since the mid-1960s, production facilities known as <em class="emphasis">maquiladoras</em> have been a regular feature of Mexican border towns, especially along the Texas and New Mexico borders. US multinational companies, such as John Deere, Zenith, Mattel, and Xerox, run the majority of the more than 3,600 maquiladoras in northern Mexico. Billions of dollars’ worth of products—from televisions to clothes to auto parts—are assembled in maquiladoras and then shipped back, tax free, to the United States for sale to US consumers.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p07">Maquiladoras employ more than a million Mexicans, mostly unskilled women in their twenties and early thirties who work long hours. Wages and benefits are generally poor but much better than in the rest of Mexico. The huge growth in trade between the United States and Mexico has greatly expanded the role—and scale—of these assembly operations.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p08">Along with the benefits, challenges have also come with the increased trade. A large number of Mexicans are concerned that wealth is distributed more unevenly than ever. For example, many commentators see the political situation in the state of Chiapas as underscoring the alienation large groups have suffered as a result of the opening of the Mexican economy to global forces. A rural region in southern Mexico, Chiapas is home to extremely poor Mayan, Ch’ol, Zoque, and Lacandón Indians. Although it is the poorest state in Mexico, Chiapas has the richest natural resources, including oil, minerals, and electrical power.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p09">On January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA officially took effect, a group of Indian peasants, commanded by Subcomandante Marcos, rose up in armed rebellion. This was shocking not only to Mexico’s leadership but to the international community. The unrest in Chiapas stems from long-standing economic and social injustice in the region and from the Indians’ isolation and exploitation by the local oligarchy of landowners and mestizo bosses (<em class="emphasis">caciques</em>). While NAFTA clearly advanced the goals of free trade, global businesses are often forced to deal with local economic, political, and social realities within a country.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p10">The Mexican government has indicated that improving the social conditions in the region is a high priority. However, only partial accords have been reached between the government and the peasants. At the same time, the army continues to exert tight control over the state, particularly in and around towns where residents are known to support the rebels.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p11">The low standard of living in Chiapas and of Indians throughout Mexico remains a significant challenge for the Mexican government. In the years following the Chiapas uprising, poverty in southern Mexico has risen to about 40 percent, while in the north, poverty has decreased thanks to closer economic links with the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_019"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Doing Business in Mexico</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

Originally, the agreement (then called the Central America Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA) encompassed discussions between the US and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. A year before the official signing, the Dominican Republic joined the negotiations, and the agreement was renamed CAFTA-DR.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_025">“Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR),” Export.gov, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.export.gov/FTA/cafta-dr/index.asp">http://www.export.gov/FTA/cafta-dr/index.asp</a>.</span></p>

For free trade advocates, the CAFTA-DR is also seen as a stepping stone toward the eventual establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)—the more ambitious grouping for a free trade agreement that would encompass all the South American and Caribbean nations as well as those of North and Central America (except Cuba). Canada is currently negotiating a similar treaty called the Canada Central American Free Trade Agreement.

With the removal of virtually all tariffs and other barriers to trade, the CAFTA-DR agreement is making commerce with these countries even easier, opening opportunities to a range of industries.

And within the United States, no location is as well positioned as Florida to act as the gateway to the CAFTA-DR markets.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p01">The European Union (EU) is the most integrated form of economic cooperation. As you learned in the opening case study, the EU originally began in 1950 to end the frequent wars between neighboring countries in the Europe. The six founding nations were France, West Germany, Italy, and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Benelux countries</a><span class="glossdef">The grouping of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.</span></span> (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), all of which signed a treaty to run their coal and steel industries under a common management. The focus was on the development of the coal and steel industries for peaceful purposes.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p02">In 1957, the six nations signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and created a common market between the members. Over the next fifty years, the EEC added nine more members and changed its name twice—to European Community (EC) in the 1970s and the European Union (EU) in 1993.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_029">“History of the European Union,” Europa, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm">http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p03">The entire history of the transformation of the EEC to the EU has been an evolutionary process. However, the Treaty of Maastricht in 1993 stands out as an important moment; it’s when the <em class="emphasis">real</em> economic union was created. With this treaty, the EU identified three aims. The first was to establish a single, common currency, which went into effect in 1999. The second was to set up monetary and fiscal targets for member countries. Third, the treaty called for a political union, which would include the development of a common foreign and defense policy and common citizenship. The opening case study addressed some of the current challenges the EU is facing as a result of the impact of these aims. Despite the challenges, the EU is likely to endure given its historic legacy. Furthermore, a primary goal for the development of the EU was that Europeans realized that they needed a larger trading platform to compete against the US and the emerging markets of China and India. Individually, the European countries would never have the economic power they now have collectively as the EU.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p04">Today, the EU has twenty-seven member countries. Croatia, Iceland, Macedonia, and Turkey are the next set of candidates for future membership. In 2009, the twenty-seven EU countries signed the Treaty of Lisbon, which amends the previous treaties. It is designed to make the EU more democratic, efficient, and transparent and to tackle global challenges, such as climate change, security, and sustainable development.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p05">The European Economic Area (EEA) was established on January 1, 1994, following an agreement between the member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EC (later the EU). Specifically, it has allowed Iceland (now an EU candidate), Liechtenstein, and Norway to participate in the EU’s single market without a conventional EU membership. Switzerland has also chosen to not join the EU, although it is part of similar bilateral agreements.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s03_p01">Overall, global businesses have benefited from the regional trade agreements by having more consistent criteria for investment and trade as well as reduced barriers to entry. Companies that choose to manufacture in one country find it easier and cheaper to move goods between member countries in that trading bloc without incurring tariffs or additional regulations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s03_p02">The challenges for businesses include finding themselves outside of a new trading bloc or having the “rules” for their industry change as a result of new trade agreements. Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. It’s often called a “spaghetti bowl” of global bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, because the agreements are not linear strands lining up neatly; instead they are a messy mix of crisscrossing strands, like a bowl of spaghetti, that link countries and trading blocs in self-benefiting trading alliances. Businesses have to monitor and navigate these evolving trade agreements to make sure that one or more agreements don’t negatively impact their businesses in key countries. This is one reason why global businesses have teams of in-house professionals monitoring the WTO as well as the regional trade alliances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s03_p03">For example, American companies doing business in one of the ASEAN countries often choose to become members of the US–ASEAN Business Council, so that they can monitor and possibly influence new trade regulations as well as advance their business interests with government entities.</p>
