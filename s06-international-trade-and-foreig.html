    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_p01">It’s easy to think that trade is just about business interests in each country. But global trade is much more. There’s a convergence and, at times, a conflict of the interests of the different stakeholders—from businesses to governments to local citizens. In recent years, advancements in technology, a renewed enthusiasm for entrepreneurship, and a global sentiment that favors free trade have further connected people, businesses, and markets—all flatteners that are helping expand global trade and investment. An essential part of international business is understanding the history of international trade and what motivates countries to encourage or discourage trade within their borders. In this chapter we’ll look at the evolution of international trade theory to our modern time. We’ll explore the political and legal factors impacting international trade. This chapter will provide an introduction to the concept and role of foreign direct investment, which can take many forms of incentives, regulations, and policies. Companies react to these business incentives and regulations as they evaluate with which countries to do business and in which to invest. Governments often encourage foreign investment in their own country or in another country by providing loans and incentives to businesses in their home country as well as businesses in the recipient country in order to pave the way for investment and trade in the country. The opening case study shows how and why China is investing in the continent of Africa.</p>

Much of the trade history of past centuries has been colored by European colonial powers promoting and preserving their economic interests throughout the African continent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_001">Martin Meredith, <em class="emphasis">The Fate of Africa</em> (New York: Public Affairs, 2005).</span> After World War II and since independence for many African nations, the continent has not fared as well as other former colonial countries in Asia.

In one example with Angola, China provided loans to the country secured by oil. With this investment, Angola hired Chinese companies to build much-needed roads, railways, hospitals, schools, and water systems. Similarly, China provided nearby Nigeria with oil-backed loans to finance projects that use gas to generate electricity. In the Republic of the Congo, Chinese teams are building a hydropower project funded by a Chinese government loan, which will be repaid in oil.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s00_p09">Criticized by some and applauded by others, it’s clear that China’s investment is encouraging development in Africa. China is accused by some of ignoring human rights crises in the continent and doing business with repressive regimes. China’s success in Africa is due in large part to the local political environment in each country, where either one or a small handful of leaders often control the power and decision making. While the countries often open bids to many foreign investors, Chinese firms are able to provide low-cost options thanks in large part to their government’s project support. The ability to forge a government-level partnership has enabled Chinese businesses to have long-term investment perspectives in the region. China even hosted a summit in 2006 for African leaders, pledging to increase trade, investment, and aid over the coming decade.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_011">“Summit Shows China’s Africa Clout,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, November 6, 2006, accessed December 20, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6120500.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6120500.stm</a>.</span> The 2008 global recession has led China to be more selective in its African investments, looking for good deals as well as political stability in target countries.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_p02">In more recent centuries, economists have focused on trying to understand and explain these trade patterns. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch01#fwk-168388-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch01_s04#fwk-168388-ch01_s04">Section 1.4 "The Globalization Debate"</a> discussed how Thomas Friedman’s flat-world approach segments history into three stages: Globalization 1.0 from 1492 to 1800, 2.0 from 1800 to 2000, and 3.0 from 2000 to the present. In Globalization 1.0, nations dominated global expansion. In Globalization 2.0, multinational companies ascended and pushed global development. Today, technology drives Globalization 3.0.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_p03">To better understand how modern global trade has evolved, it’s important to understand how countries traded with one another historically. Over time, economists have developed theories to explain the mechanisms of global trade. The main historical theories are called <em class="emphasis">classical</em> and are from the perspective of a country, or country-based. By the mid-twentieth century, the theories began to shift to explain trade from a firm, rather than a country, perspective. These theories are referred to as <em class="emphasis">modern</em> and are firm-based or company-based. Both of these categories, classical and modern, consist of several international theories.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p01">Developed in the sixteenth century, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mercantilism</a><span class="glossdef">A classical, country-based international trade theory that states that a country’s wealth is determined by its holdings of gold and silver.</span></span> was one of the earliest efforts to develop an economic theory. This theory stated that a country’s wealth was determined by the amount of its gold and silver holdings. In it’s simplest sense, mercantilists believed that a country should increase its holdings of gold and silver by promoting exports and discouraging imports. In other words, if people in other countries buy more from you (exports) than they sell to you (imports), then they have to pay you the difference in gold and silver. The objective of each country was to have a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade surplus</a><span class="glossdef">When the value of exports is greater than the value of imports.</span></span>, or a situation where the value of exports are greater than the value of imports, and to avoid a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade deficit</a><span class="glossdef">When the value of imports is greater than the value of exports.</span></span>, or a situation where the value of imports is greater than the value of exports.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p02">A closer look at world history from the 1500s to the late 1800s helps explain why mercantilism flourished. The 1500s marked the rise of new nation-states, whose rulers wanted to strengthen their nations by building larger armies and national institutions. By increasing exports and trade, these rulers were able to amass more gold and wealth for their countries. One way that many of these new nations promoted exports was to impose restrictions on imports. This strategy is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">protectionism</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of imposing restrictions on imports and protecting domestic industry.</span></span> and is still used today.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p03">Nations expanded their wealth by using their colonies around the world in an effort to control more trade and amass more riches. The British colonial empire was one of the more successful examples; it sought to increase its wealth by using raw materials from places ranging from what are now the Americas and India. France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain were also successful in building large colonial empires that generated extensive wealth for their governing nations.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p04">Although mercantilism is one of the oldest trade theories, it remains part of modern thinking. Countries such as Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, and even Germany still favor exports and discourage imports through a form of neo-mercantilism in which the countries promote a combination of protectionist policies and restrictions and domestic-industry subsidies. Nearly every country, at one point or another, has implemented some form of protectionist policy to guard key industries in its economy. While export-oriented companies usually support protectionist policies that favor their industries or firms, other companies and consumers are hurt by protectionism. Taxpayers pay for government subsidies of select exports in the form of higher taxes. Import restrictions lead to higher prices for consumers, who pay more for foreign-made goods or services. Free-trade advocates highlight how free trade benefits all members of the global community, while mercantilism’s protectionist policies only benefit select industries, at the expense of both consumers and other companies, within and outside of the industry.</p>

Smith reasoned that trade between countries shouldn’t be regulated or restricted by government policy or intervention. He stated that trade should flow naturally according to market forces. In a hypothetical two-country world, if Country A could produce a good cheaper or faster (or both) than Country B, then Country A had the advantage and could focus on specializing on producing that good. Similarly, if Country B was better at producing another good, it could focus on specialization as well. By specialization, countries would generate efficiencies, because their labor force would become more skilled by doing the same tasks. Production would also become more efficient, because there would be an incentive to create faster and better production methods to increase the specialization.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s02_p02">Smith’s theory reasoned that with increased efficiencies, people in both countries would benefit and trade should be encouraged.

                <h2 class="title editable block">Comparative Advantage</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s03_p01">The challenge to the absolute advantage theory was that some countries may be better at producing both goods and, therefore, have an advantage in <em class="emphasis">many</em> areas. In contrast, another country may not have <em class="emphasis">any</em> useful absolute advantages. To answer this challenge, David Ricardo, an English economist, introduced the theory of comparative advantage in 1817. Ricardo reasoned that even if Country A had the absolute advantage in the production of <em class="emphasis">both</em> products, specialization and trade could still occur between two countries.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Comparative advantage</a><span class="glossdef">The situation in which a country cannot produce a product more efficiently than another country; however, it does produce that product better and more efficiently than it does another good.</span></span> occurs when a country cannot produce a product more efficiently than the other country; however, it <em class="emphasis">can</em> produce that product better and more efficiently than it does other goods. The difference between these two theories is subtle. Comparative advantage focuses on the relative productivity differences, whereas absolute advantage looks at the absolute productivity.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s03_p03">Let’s look at a simplified hypothetical example to illustrate the subtle difference between these principles. Miranda is a Wall Street lawyer who charges $500 per hour for her legal services. It turns out that Miranda can also type faster than the administrative assistants in her office, who are paid $40 per hour. Even though Miranda clearly has the absolute advantage in both skill sets, should she do both jobs? No. For every hour Miranda decides to type instead of do legal work, she would be giving up $460 in income. Her productivity and income will be highest if she specializes in the higher-paid legal services and hires the most qualified administrative assistant, who can type fast, although a little slower than Miranda. By having both Miranda and her assistant concentrate on their respective tasks, their overall productivity as a team is higher. This is comparative advantage. A person or a country will specialize in doing what they do <em class="emphasis">relatively</em> better. In reality, the world economy is more complex and consists of more than two countries and products. Barriers to trade may exist, and goods must be transported, stored, and distributed. However, this simplistic example demonstrates the basis of the comparative advantage theory.</p>

Both theories assumed that free and open markets would lead countries and producers to determine which goods they could produce more efficiently. In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, focused their attention on how a country could gain comparative advantage by producing products that utilized factors that were in abundance in the country. Their theory is based on a country’s production factors—land, labor, and capital, which provide the funds for investment in plants and equipment. They determined that the cost of any factor or resource was a function of supply and demand. Factors that were in great supply relative to demand would be cheaper; factors in great demand relative to supply would be more expensive. Their theory, also called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factor proportions theory</a><span class="glossdef">Also called the Heckscher-Ohlin theory; the classical, country-based international theory states that countries would gain comparative advantage if they produced and exported goods that required resources or factors that they had in great supply and therefore were cheaper production factors.

Leontief studied the US economy closely and noted that the United States was abundant in capital and, therefore, should export more capital-intensive goods. However, his research using actual data showed the opposite: the United States was importing more capital-intensive goods. According to the factor proportions theory, the United States should have been importing labor-intensive goods, but instead it was actually exporting them. His analysis became known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Leontief Paradox</a><span class="glossdef">A paradox identified by Russian economist Wassily W. Leontief that states, in the real world, the reverse of the factor proportions theory exists in some countries. For example, even though a country may be abundant in capital, it may still import more capital-intensive goods.</span></span> because it was the reverse of what was expected by the factor proportions theory. In subsequent years, economists have noted historically at that point in time, labor in the United States was both available in steady supply and more productive than in many other countries; hence it made sense to export labor-intensive goods. Over the decades, many economists have used theories and data to explain and minimize the impact of the paradox. However, what remains clear is that international trade is complex and is impacted by numerous and often-changing factors. Trade cannot be explained neatly by one single theory, and more importantly, our understanding of international trade theories continues to evolve.</p>

Linder’s theory proposed that consumers in countries that are in the same or similar stage of development would have similar preferences. In this firm-based theory, Linder suggested that companies first produce for domestic consumption. When they explore exporting, the companies often find that markets that look similar to their domestic one, in terms of customer preferences, offer the most potential for success. Linder’s country similarity theory then states that most trade in manufactured goods will be between countries with similar per capita incomes, and intraindustry trade will be common. This theory is often most useful in understanding trade in goods where brand names and product reputations are important factors in the buyers’ decision-making and purchasing processes.</p>

The theory, originating in the field of marketing, stated that a product life cycle has three distinct stages: (1) new product, (2) maturing product, and (3) standardized product. The theory assumed that production of the new product will occur completely in the home country of its innovation. In the 1960s this was a useful theory to explain the manufacturing success of the United States. US manufacturing was the globally dominant producer in many industries after World War II.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s02_s02_p02">It has also been used to describe how the personal computer (PC) went through its product cycle. The PC was a new product in the 1970s and developed into a mature product during the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the PC is in the standardized product stage, and the majority of manufacturing and production process is done in low-cost countries in Asia and Mexico.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s02_s02_s02_p03">The product life cycle theory has been less able to explain current trade patterns where innovation and manufacturing occur around the world. For example, global companies even conduct research and development in developing markets where highly skilled labor and facilities are usually cheaper. Even though research and development is typically associated with the first or new product stage and therefore completed in the home country, these developing or emerging-market countries, such as India and China, offer both highly skilled labor and new research facilities at a substantial cost advantage for global firms.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Local market resources and capabilities (factor conditions).</strong> Porter recognized the value of the factor proportions theory, which considers a nation’s resources (e.g., natural resources and available labor) as key factors in determining what products a country will import or export. Porter added to these basic factors a new list of advanced factors, which he defined as skilled labor, investments in education, technology, and infrastructure. He perceived these advanced factors as providing a country with a sustainable competitive advantage.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Local market demand conditions.</strong> Porter believed that a sophisticated home market is critical to ensuring ongoing innovation, thereby creating a sustainable competitive advantage.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s03_p01">The theories covered in this chapter are simply that—theories. While they have helped economists, governments, and businesses better understand international trade and how to promote, regulate, and manage it, these theories are occasionally contradicted by real-world events. Countries don’t have absolute advantages in many areas of production or services and, in fact, the factors of production aren’t neatly distributed between countries. Some countries have a disproportionate benefit of some factors. The United States has ample arable land that can be used for a wide range of agricultural products. It also has extensive access to capital. While it’s labor pool may not be the cheapest, it is among the best educated in the world. These advantages in the factors of production have helped the United States become the largest and richest economy in the world. Nevertheless, the United States also imports a vast amount of goods and services, as US consumers use their wealth to purchase what they need and want—much of which is now manufactured in other countries that have sought to create their own comparative advantages through cheap labor, land, or production costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s01_s03_p02">As a result, it’s not clear that any one theory is dominant around the world. This section has sought to highlight the basics of international trade theory to enable you to understand the realities that face global businesses. In practice, governments and companies use a combination of these theories to both interpret trends and develop strategy. Just as these theories have evolved over the past five hundred years, they will continue to change and adapt as new factors impact international trade.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_p02">Until recently, governments were able to directly enforce the rules and regulations based on their political and legal philosophies. The Internet has started to change this, as sellers and buyers have easier access to each other.

In reality, neither extreme exists in its purest form. Instead, most countries have a combination of both, the balance of which is often a reflection of the country’s history, culture, and religion. This combination is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pluralism</a><span class="glossdef">A political ideology that asserts that both public and private groups are important in a well-functioning political system.</span></span>, which asserts that both public and private groups are important in a well-functioning political system. Although most countries are pluralistic politically, they may lean more to one extreme than the other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p03">In some countries, the government controls more aspects of daily life than in others. While the common usage treats totalitarian and authoritarian as synonyms, there is a distinct difference. For the purpose of this discussion, the main relevant difference is in ideology. Authoritarian governments centralize all control in the hands of one strong leader or a small group of leaders, who have full authority. These leaders are not democratically elected and are not politically, economically, or socially accountable to the people in the country. Totalitarianism, a more extreme form of authoritarianism, occurs when an authoritarian leadership is motivated by a distinct ideology, such as communism. In totalitarianism, the ideology influences or controls the people, not just a person or party. Authoritarian leaders tend not to have a guiding philosophy and use more fear and corruption to maintain control.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Democracy</a><span class="glossdef">A form of government that derives its power from the people.</span></span> is the most common form of government around the world today. Democratic governments derive their power from the people of the country, either by direct referendum (called a direct democracy) or by means of elected representatives of the people (a representative democracy). Democracy has a number of variations, both in theory and practice, some of which provide better representation and more freedoms for their citizens than others.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p10">What businesses must focus on is how a country’s political system impacts the economy as well as the particular firm and industry. Firms need to assess the balance to determine how local policies, rules, and regulations will affect their business. Depending on how long a company expects to operate in a country and how easy it is for it to enter and exit, a firm may also assess the country’s political risk and stability. A company may ask several questions regarding a prospective country’s government to assess possible risks:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>How stable is the government?</li>

            <li>If a new party comes into power, will the rules of business change dramatically?</li>
            <li>Is power concentrated in the hands of a few, or is it clearly outlined in a constitution or similar national legal document?</li>
            <li>How involved is the government in the private sector?</li>
            <li>Is there a well-established legal environment both to enforce policies and rules as well as to challenge them?</li>
            <li>How transparent is the government’s political, legal, and economic decision-making process?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p11">While any country can, in theory, pose a risk in all of these factors, some countries offer a more stable business environment than others. In fact, political stability is a key part of government efforts to attract foreign investment to their country. Businesses need to assess if a country believes in free markets, government control, or heavy intervention (often to the benefit of a few) in industry. The country’s view on capitalism is also a factor for business consideration. In the broadest sense, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capitalism</a><span class="glossdef">An economic system in which the means of production are owned and controlled privately.</span></span> is an economic system in which the means of production are owned and controlled privately.

Historically, democratic governments have supported capitalism and authoritarian regimes have tended to utilize a state-controlled approach to managing the economy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p12">As you might expect, established democracies, such as those found in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia, offer a high level of political stability. While many countries in Asia and Latin America also are functioning democracies, their stage of development impacts the stability of their economic and trade policy, which can fluctuate with government changes. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09#fwk-168388-ch09">Chapter 4 "World Economies"</a> provides more details about developed and developing countries and emerging markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p13">Within reason, in democracies, businesses understand that most rules survive changes in government. Any changes are usually a reflection of a changing economic environment, like the world economic crisis of 2008, and not a change in the government players.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p14">This contrasts with more authoritarian governments, where democracy is either not in effect or simply a token process. China is one of the more visible examples, with its strong government and limited individual rights. However, in the past two decades, China has pursued a new balance of how much the state plans and manages the national economy. While the government still remains the dominant force by controlling more than a third of the economy, more private businesses have emerged. China has successfully combined state intervention with private investment to develop a robust, market-driven economy—all within a communist form of government. This system is commonly referred to as “a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics.” The Chinese are eager to portray their version of combining an authoritarian form of government with a market-oriented economy as a better alternative model for fledging economies, such as those in Africa. This new combination has also posed more questions for businesses that are encountering new issues—such as privacy, individual rights, and intellectual rights protections—as they try to do business with China, now the second-largest economy in the world behind the United States. The Chinese model of an authoritarian government and a market-oriented economy has, at times, tilted favor toward companies, usually Chinese, who understand how to navigate the nuances of this new system. Chinese government control on the Internet, for example, has helped propel homegrown, Baidu, a Chinese search engine, which earns more than 73 percent of the Chinese search-engine revenues. Baidu self-censors and, as a result, has seen its revenues soar after Google limited its operations in the country.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_018">Rolfe Winkler, “Internet Plus China Equals Screaming Baidu,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, November 9, 2010, accessed December 21, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602781130437538.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602781130437538.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s01_p15">It might seem straightforward to assume that businesses prefer to operate only in democratic, capitalist countries where there is little or no government involvement or intervention. However, history demonstrates that, for some industries, global firms have chosen to do business with countries whose governments control that industry. Businesses in industries, such as commodities and oil, have found more authoritarian governments to be predictable partners for long-term access and investment for these commodities. The complexity of trade in these situations increases, as throughout history, governments have come to the aid and protection of their nation’s largest business interests in markets around the world. The history of the oil industry shows how various governments have, on occasion, protected their national companies’ access to oil through political force. In current times, the Chinese government has been using a combination of government loans and investment in Africa to obtain access for Chinese companies to utilize local resources and commodities. Many business analysts mention these issues in discussions of global business ethics and the role and responsibility of companies in different political environments.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Are the Different Legal Systems?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Let’s focus briefly on how the political and economic ideologies that define countries impact their legal systems.

Most countries actually have a combination of these systems, creating hybrid legal systems.</p>

The most commonly known example of religious law is Islamic law, also known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sharia</a><span class="glossdef">Islamic religious law that addresses all aspect of daily life; in terms of business and finance, the law prohibits charging interest on money and other common investment activities, including hedging and short selling.</span></span>. Islamic law governs a number of Islamic nations and communities around the world and is the most widely accepted religious law system. Two additional religious law systems are the Jewish Halacha and the Christian Canon system, neither of which is practiced at the national level in a country. The Christian Canon system is observed in the Vatican City.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s02_p05">The most direct impact on business can be observed in Islamic law—which is a moral, rather than a commercial, legal system. Sharia has clear guidelines for aspects of life. For example, in Islamic law, business is directly impacted by the concept of interest. According to Islamic law, banks cannot charge or benefit from interest. This provision has generated an entire set of financial products and strategies to simulate interest—or a gain—for an Islamic bank, while not technically being classified as interest. Some banks will charge a large up-front fee. Many are permitted to engage in sale-buyback or leaseback of an asset. For example, if a company wants to borrow money from an Islamic bank, it would sell its assets or product to the bank for a fixed price. At the same time, an agreement would be signed for the bank to sell back the assets to the company at a later date and at a higher price. The difference between the sale and buyback price functions as the interest. In the Persian Gulf region alone, there are twenty-two Sharia-compliant, Islamic banks, which in 2008 had approximately $300 billion in assets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_019">Tala Malik, “Gulf Islamic Bank Assets to Hit $300bn,” <em class="emphasis">Arabian Business</em>, February 20, 2008, accessed December 21, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.arabianbusiness.com/511804-gulf-islamic-banks-assets-to-hit-300bn">http://www.arabianbusiness.com/511804-gulf-islamic-banks-assets-to-hit-300bn</a>.</span> Clearly, many global businesses and investment banks are finding creative ways to do business with these Islamic banks so that they can comply with Islamic law while earning a profit.</p>

Some industries may be considered essential for national security purposes, such as defense, telecommunications, and infrastructure—for example, a government may be concerned about who owns the ports within its country. National security issues can impact both the import and exports of a country, as some governments may not want advanced technological information to be sold to unfriendly foreign interests. Some governments use trade as a retaliatory measure if another country is politically or economically unfair. On the other hand, governments may influence trade to reward a country for political support on global matters.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p01">While the past century has seen a major shift toward free trade, many governments continue to intervene in trade. Governments have several key policy areas that can be used to create rules and regulations to control and manage trade.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tariffs.</strong> Tariffs are taxes imposed on imports. Two kinds of tariffs exist—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific tariffs</a><span class="glossdef">Taxes or tariffs that are levied as a fixed charge, regardless of the value of the product or service.</span></span>, which are levied as a fixed charge, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ad valorem tariffs</a><span class="glossdef">Tariffs that are calculated as a percentage of the value of the product or service.</span></span>, which are calculated as a percentage of the value. Many governments still charge ad valorem tariffs as a way to regulate imports and raise revenues for their coffers.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Subsidies.</strong> A subsidy is a form of government payment to a producer. Types of subsidies include tax breaks or low-interest loans; both of which are common. Subsidies can also be cash grants and government-equity participation, which are less common because they require a direct use of government resources.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Import quotas and VER.</strong> Import quotas and voluntary export restraints (VER) are two strategies to limit the amount of imports into a country. The importing government directs import quotas, while VER are imposed at the discretion of the exporting nation in conjunction with the importing one.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Currency controls.</strong> Governments may limit the convertibility of one currency (usually its own) into others, usually in an effort to limit imports. Additionally, some governments will manage the exchange rate at a high level to create an import disincentive.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Local content requirements.</strong> Many countries continue to require that a certain percentage of a product or an item be manufactured or “assembled” locally. Some countries specify that a local firm must be used as the domestic partner to conduct business.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Antidumping rules.</strong> Dumping occurs when a company sells product below market price often in order to win market share and weaken a competitor.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Export financing.</strong> Governments provide financing to domestic companies to promote exports.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Free-trade zone.</strong> Many countries designate certain geographic areas as free-trade zones. These areas enjoy reduced tariffs, taxes, customs, procedures, or restrictions in an effort to promote trade with other countries.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Administrative policies.</strong> These are the bureaucratic policies and procedures governments may use to deter imports by making entry or operations more difficult and time consuming.</li>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p02">As shown in the opening case study, China is using its economic might to invest in Africa. China’s ability to focus on dominating key industries inspires both fear and awe throughout the world. A closer look at the solar industry in China illustrates the government’s ability to create new industries and companies based on its objectives. With its huge population, China is in constant need of energy to meet the needs of its people and businesses.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p03">As a result, the government has placed a priority on energy related technologies, including solar energy. China’s expanding solar-energy industry is dependent on polycrystalline silicon, the main raw material for solar panels. Facing a shortage in 2007, growing domestic demand, and high prices from foreign companies that dominated production, China declared the development of domestic polysilicon supplies a priority. Domestic Chinese manufacturers received quick loans with favorable terms as well as speedy approvals. One entrepreneur, Zhu Gongshan, received $1 billion in funding, including a sizeable investment from China’s sovereign wealth fund, in record time, enabling his firm GCL-Poly Energy Holding to become one of the world’s biggest in less than three years. The company now has a 25 percent market share of polysilicon and almost 50 percent of the global market for solar-power equipment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_023">Jason Dean, Andrew Browne, and Shai Oster, “China’s ‘State Capitalism’ Sparks Global Backlash,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, November 16, 2010, accessed December 22, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602731006315198.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602731006315198.html</a>.</span></p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s02_s03_s02_l02">
                    <li>There are more than thirteen major types of government and each type consists of multiple variations. At one end of the political ideology extremes is anarchism, which contends that individuals should control political activities and public government is both unnecessary and unwanted. The other extreme is totalitarianism, which contends that every aspect of an individual’s life should be controlled and dictated by a strong central government. Neither extreme exists in its purest form in the real world. Instead, most countries have a combination of both. This combination is called pluralism, which asserts that both public and private groups are important in a well-functioning political system. Democracy is the most common form of government today. Democratic governments derive their power from the people of the country either by direct referendum, called a direct democracy, or by means of elected representatives of the people, known as a representative democracy.</li>
                    <li>Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are owned and controlled privately. In contrast a planned economy is one in which the government or state directs and controls the economy.</li>
                    <li>There are three main types of legal systems: (1) civil law, (2) common law, and (3) religious law. In practice, countries use a combination of one or more of these systems and often adapt them to suit the local values and culture.</li>
                    <li>Government-business trade relations are the relationships between national governments and global businesses. Governments intervene in trade to protect their nation’s economy and industry, as well as promote and preserve their social, cultural, political, and economic structures and philosophies. Governments have several key policy areas in which they can create rules and regulations in order to control and manage trade, including tariffs, subsidies; import quotas and VER, currency controls, local content requirements, antidumping rules, export financing, free-trade zones, and administrative policies.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Understand the Types of International Investments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s01_p01">There are two main categories of international investment—portfolio investment and foreign direct investment. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Portfolio investment</a><span class="glossdef">The investment in a company’s stocks, bonds, or assets, but not for the purpose of controlling or directing the firm’s operations or management.</span></span> refers to the investment in a company’s stocks, bonds, or assets, but not for the purpose of controlling or directing the firm’s operations or management. Typically, investors in this category are looking for a financial rate of return as well as diversifying investment risk through multiple markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Foreign direct investment (FDI)</a><span class="glossdef">The acquisition of foreign assets with the intent to control and manage them.</span></span> refers to an investment in or the acquisition of foreign assets with the intent to control and manage them. Companies can make an FDI in several ways, including purchasing the assets of a foreign company; investing in the company or in new property, plants, or equipment; or participating in a joint venture with a foreign company, which typically involves an investment of capital or know-how. FDI is primarily a long-term strategy. Companies usually expect to benefit through access to local markets and resources, often in exchange for expertise, technical know-how, and capital. A country’s FDI can be both inward and outward. As the terms would suggest, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inward FDI</a><span class="glossdef">An investment into a country by a company from another country.</span></span> refers to investments coming into the country and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outward FDI</a><span class="glossdef">An investment made by a domestic company into companies in other countries.</span></span> are investments made by companies from that country into foreign companies in other countries. The difference between inward and outward is called the net FDI inflow, which can be either positive or negative.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s01_p03">Governments want to be able to control and regulate the flow of FDI so that local political and economic concerns are addressed. Global businesses are most interested in using FDI to benefit their companies. As a result, these two players—governments and companies—can at times be at odds. It’s important to understand why companies use FDI as a business strategy and how governments regulate and manage FDI.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Factors That Influence a Company’s Decision to Invest</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Let’s look at why and how companies choose to invest in foreign markets. Simply purchasing goods and services or deciding to invest in a local market depends on a business’s needs and overall strategy. Direct investment in a country occurs when a company chooses to set up facilities to produce or market their products; or seeks to partner with, invest in, or purchase a local company for control and access to the local market, production, or resources. Many considerations influence its decisions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cost.</strong> Is it cheaper to produce in the local market than elsewhere?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Logistics.</strong> Is it cheaper to produce locally if the transportation costs are significant?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Market.</strong> Has the company identified a significant local market?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Natural resources.</strong> Is the company interested in obtaining access to local resources or commodities?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Know-how.</strong> Does the company want access to local technology or business process knowledge?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customers and competitors.</strong> Does the company’s clients or competitors operate in the country?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Policy.</strong> Are there local incentives (cash and noncash) for investing in one country versus another?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ease.</strong> Is it relatively straightforward to invest and/or set up operations in the country, or is there another country in which setup might be easier?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Culture.</strong> Is the workforce or labor pool already skilled for the company’s needs or will extensive training be required?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Impact.</strong> How will this investment impact the company’s revenue and profitability?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Expatriation of funds.</strong> Can the company easily take profits out of the country, or are there local restrictions?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exit.</strong> Can the company easily and orderly exit from a local investment, or are local laws and regulations cumbersome and expensive?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p02">These are just a few of the many factors that might influence a company’s decision. Keep in mind that a company doesn’t need to sell in the local market in order to deem it a good option for direct investment. For example, companies set up manufacturing facilities in low-cost countries but export the products to other markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p03">There are two forms of FDI—horizontal and vertical. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Horizontal FDI</a><span class="glossdef">When a company is trying to open up a new market that is similar to its domestic markets.</span></span> occurs when a company is trying to open up a new market—a retailer, for example, that builds a store in a new country to sell to the local market. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Vertical FDI</a><span class="glossdef">When a company invests internationally to provide input into its core operations usually in its home country. A firm may invest in production facilities in another country. If the firm brings the goods or components back to its home country (acting as a supplier), then it is called backward vertical FDI.

A firm may invest in production facilities in another country. When a firm brings the goods or components back to its home country (i.e., acting as a supplier), this is referred to as backward vertical FDI. When a firm sells the goods into the local or regional market (i.e., acting as a distributor), this is termed forward vertical FDI. The largest global companies often engage in both backward and forward vertical FDI depending on their industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p04">Many firms engage in backward vertical FDI. The auto, oil, and infrastructure (which includes industries related to enhancing the infrastructure of a country—that is, energy, communications, and transportation) industries are good examples of this. Firms from these industries invest in production or plant facilities in a country in order to supply raw materials, parts, or finished products to their home country. In recent years, these same industries have also started to provide forward FDI by supplying raw materials, parts, or finished products to newly emerging local or regional markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p05">There are different kinds of FDI, two of which—greenfield and brownfield—are increasingly applicable to global firms. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Greenfield FDIs</a><span class="glossdef">An FDI strategy in which a company builds new facilities from scratch.</span></span> occur when multinational corporations enter into developing countries to build new factories or stores. These new facilities are built from scratch—usually in an area where no previous facilities existed. The name originates from the idea of building a facility on a green field, such as farmland or a forested area. In addition to building new facilities that best meet their needs, the firms also create new long-term jobs in the foreign country by hiring new employees. Countries often offer prospective companies tax breaks, subsidies, and other incentives to set up greenfield investments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p06">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brownfield FDI</a><span class="glossdef">An FDI strategy in which a company or government entity purchases or leases existing production facilities to launch a new production activity.</span></span> is when a company or government entity purchases or leases existing production facilities to launch a new production activity. One application of this strategy is where a commercial site used for an “unclean” business purpose, such as a steel mill or oil refinery, is cleaned up and used for a less polluting purpose, such as commercial office space or a residential area. Brownfield investment is usually less expensive and can be implemented faster; however, a company may have to deal with many challenges, including existing employees, outdated equipment, entrenched processes, and cultural differences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s02_p07">You should note that the terms <em class="emphasis">greenfield</em> and <em class="emphasis">brownfield</em> are not exclusive to FDI; you may hear them in various business contexts. In general, greenfield refers to starting from the beginning, and brownfield refers to modifying or upgrading existing plans or projects.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why and How Governments Encourage FDI</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_p01">Many governments encourage FDI in their countries as a way to create jobs, expand local technical knowledge, and increase their overall economic standards.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_027">Ian Bremmer, <em class="emphasis">The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations</em> (New York: Portfolio, 2010).</span> Countries like Hong Kong and Singapore long ago realized that both global trade and FDI would help them grow exponentially and improve the standard of living for their citizens. As a result, Hong Kong (before its return to China) was one of the easiest places to set up a new company. Guidelines were clearly available, and businesses could set up a new office within days. Similarly, Singapore, while a bit more discriminatory on the size and type of business, offered foreign companies a clear, streamlined process for setting up a new company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_p02">In contrast, for decades, many other countries in Asia (e.g., India, China, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Indonesia) restricted or controlled FDI in their countries by requiring extensive paperwork and bureaucratic approvals as well as local partners for any new foreign business. These policies created disincentives for many global companies. By the 1990s (and earlier for China), many of the countries in Asia had caught the global trade bug and were actively trying to modify their policies to encourage more FDI. Some were more successful than others, often as a result of internal political issues and pressures rather than from any repercussions of global trade.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_028">UNCTAD compiles statistics on foreign direct investment (FDI): “Foreign Direct Investment database,” UNCTAD United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, accessed February 16, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://unctadstat.unctad.org/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx?sRF_ActivePath=P,5,27&amp;sRF_Expanded=,P,5,27&amp;sCS_ChosenLang=en">http://unctadstat.unctad.org/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx?sRF_ActivePath=P,5,27&amp;sRF_Expanded=,P,5,27&amp;sCS_ChosenLang=en</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s01_p01">In most instances, governments seek to limit or control foreign direct investment to protect local industries and key resources (oil, minerals, etc.), preserve the national and local culture, protect segments of their domestic population, maintain political and economic independence, and manage or control economic growth. A government use various policies and rules:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ownership restrictions.</strong> Host governments can specify ownership restrictions if they want to keep the control of local markets or industries in their citizens’ hands. Some countries, such as Malaysia, go even further and encourage that ownership be maintained by a person of Malay origin, known locally as <em class="emphasis">bumiputra</em>. Although the country’s Foreign Investment Committee guidelines are being relaxed, most foreign businesses understand that having a <em class="emphasis">bumiputra</em> partner will improve their chances of obtaining favorable contracts in Malaysia.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tax rates and sanctions.</strong> A company’s home government usually imposes these restrictions in an effort to persuade companies to invest in the domestic market rather than a foreign one.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p01">Governments seek to promote FDI when they are eager to expand their domestic economy and attract new technologies, business know-how, and capital to their country. In these instances, many governments still try to manage and control the type, quantity, and even the nationality of the FDI to achieve their domestic, economic, political, and social goals.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Financial incentives.</strong> Host countries offer businesses a combination of tax incentives and loans to invest. Home-country governments may also offer a combination of insurance, loans, and tax breaks in an effort to promote their companies’ overseas investments. The opening case on China in Africa illustrated these types of incentives.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Infrastructure.</strong> Host governments improve or enhance local infrastructure—in energy, transportation, and communications—to encourage specific industries to invest. This also serves to improve the local conditions for domestic firms.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Administrative processes and regulatory environment.</strong> Host-country governments streamline the process of establishing offices or production in their countries. By reducing bureaucracy and regulatory environments, these countries appear more attractive to foreign firms.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Invest in education.</strong> Countries seek to improve their workforce through education and job training. An educated and skilled workforce is an important investment criterion for many global businesses.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Political, economic, and legal stability.</strong> Host-country governments seek to reassure businesses that the local operating conditions are stable, transparent (i.e., policies are clearly stated and in the public domain), and unlikely to change.</li>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p02">Governments seek to encourage FDI for a variety of reasons. On occasion, though, the process can cross the lines of ethics and legality. In November 2010, seven global companies paid the US Justice Department “a combined $236 million in fines to settle allegations that they or their contractors bribed foreign officials to smooth the way for importing equipment and materials into several countries.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_029">Kara Scannell, “Shell, Six Other Firms Settle Foreign-Bribery Probe,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, November 5, 2010, accessed December 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704805204575594311301043920.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704805204575594311301043920.html</a>.</span> The companies included Shell and contractors Transocean, Noble, Pride International, Global Santa Fe, Tidewater, and Panalpina World Transport. The bribes were paid to officials in oil-rich countries—Nigeria, Brazil, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Angola. In the United States, global firms—including ones headquartered elsewhere, but trading on any of the US stock exchanges—are prohibited from paying or even offering to pay bribes to foreign government officials or employees of state-owned businesses with the intent of currying business favors. While the law and the business ethics are clear, in many cases, the penalty fines remain much less onerous than losing critical long-term business revenues.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn05_030">Kara Scannell, “Shell, Six Other Firms Settle Foreign-Bribery Probe,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, November 5, 2010, accessed December 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704805204575594311301043920.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704805204575594311301043920.html</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p03">Policies of openness to FDI and international trade have enabled countries around the world to leapfrog economically over their neighbors. The historical rise of Hong Kong is one example. Hong Kong’s economic strengths can be traced to a combination of factors, including its business-friendly laws and policies, a local population that is culturally oriented to transacting trade and business, and Hong Kong’s geographic proximity to the major economies of China, Japan, and Taiwan.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p04">Hong Kong has always been open to global trade. Many people, from the Chinese to the Japanese to the British, have occupied Hong Kong over the centuries, and all of them have contributed to its development as one of the world’s great ports and trading centers.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p05">In 1997, Hong Kong reverted back to Chinese control; however, free enterprise will be governed under the agreement of Basic Law, which established Hong Kong as a separate Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. Under its Basic Law, in force until 2047, Hong Kong will retain its legal, social, economic, and political systems apart from China’s. Thus, Hong Kong is guaranteed the right to its own monetary system and financial autonomy. Hong Kong is allowed to work independently with the international community; to control trade in strategic commodities, drugs, and illegal transshipments; and to protect intellectual property rights. Under the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR maintains an independent tax system and the right to free trade.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p06">Hong Kong has an open business structure, which freely encourages foreign direct investment. Any company that wishes to do business here is free to do so as long as it complies with local laws. Hong Kong’s legal and institutional framework combined with its good banking and financial facilities and business-friendly tax systems have encouraged foreign direct investment as many multinationals located their regional headquarters in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p07">As a base for doing business with China, Hong Kong now accounts for half of all direct investments in the mainland and is China’s main conduit for investment and trade. China has also become a major investor in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p08">Culturally, many foreign firms are attracted to Hong Kong by its skilled workforce and the fact that Hong Kong still conducts business in English, a remnant of its British colonial influence. The imprint of the early British trading firms, known as <em class="emphasis">hongs</em>, is particularly strong today in the area of property development. Jardine Matheson and Company, for instance, founded by trader William Jardine, remains one of Hong Kong’s preeminent firms. In many of these companies, British management practices remain firmly in place. Every aspect of Hong Kong’s business laws—whether pertaining to contracts, taxes, or trusts—bears striking similarities to the laws in Britain. All these factors contribute to a business culture that is familiar to people in many multinationals.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p09">Chinese cultural influences have always affected business and are increasingly so today. Many pundits claim that Hong Kong already resembles China’s free-trade zone. And, indeed, the two economies are becoming increasingly intertwined. Much of this economic commingling began in the 1990s, when Hong Kong companies began relocating production centers to the mainland—especially to Guangdong province.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p10">Because of the shift in production to mainland China and other Asian countries, there is not much manufacturing left in Hong Kong. What remains is light in nature and veers toward high-value-added products. In fact, 80 percent of Hong Kong’s gross domestic product now comes from its high value-added service sector: finance, business and legal services, brokerage services, the shipping and cargo industries, and the hotel, food, and beverage industry.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p11">Local Hong Kong companies, as well as foreign businesses based there, are uniquely positioned to play important roles as brokers and intermediaries between the mainland and global corporations. Doing business in China is not only complex and daunting but also requires connections, locally known as <em class="emphasis">guanxi</em>, to influential people and an understanding of local laws and protocol. Developing these relationships and this knowledge is almost impossible without the assistance of an insider. It is in this role that the Hong Kong business community stands to contribute enormously.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s03_s03_s02_p12">Hong Kong’s openness to foreign investment coupled with its proximity to China will ensure its global economic competitiveness for decades to come.</p>

                    <li>There are two main categories of international investment: portfolio investment and foreign direct investment (FDI). Portfolio investment refers to the investment in a company’s stocks, bonds, or assets, but not for the purpose of controlling or directing the firm’s operations or management. FDI refers to an investment in or the acquisition of foreign assets with the intent to control and manage them.</li>
                    <li>Direct investment in a country occurs when a company chooses to set up facilities to produce or market its products or seeks to partner with, invest in, or purchase a local company for control and access to the local market, production, or resources. Many considerations can influence the company’s decisions, including cost, logistics, market, natural resources, know-how, customers and competitors, policy, ease of entry and exit, culture, impact on revenue and profitability, and expatriation of funds.</li>
                    <li>Governments discourage or restrict FDI through ownership restrictions, tax rates, and sanctions. Governments encourage FDI through financial incentives; well-established infrastructure; desirable administrative processes and regulatory environment; educational investment; and political, economic, and legal stability.</li>

Are you wondering where the best country to start a business might be? The <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> recently made an effort to answer this question by reviewing data from global surveys. Contrary to what you might think given the global push toward globalization and a flat world, most governments still actively limit and control foreign investment.</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch05_s04_s01_p02">Governments in the developing world, for instance, often impose high costs and numerous procedures on people who are trying to get a company off the ground. In Zimbabwe, entrepreneurs will have to fork over about 500 percent of the country’s average per-capita income in government fees. Compare that with 0.7 percent in the U.S. In Equatorial Guinea, owners have to slog through 20 procedures to get their venture going, versus just one in Canada and New Zealand. Still, lots of countries are making progress. In a World Bank study of red tape, Samoa was singled out for making the most strides in reforming its practices. It went from one of the toughest places in the world to start a company last year—131st out of 183—to No. 20 this year…China, for instance, ranks as just the 40th best place in the world to start a company.
