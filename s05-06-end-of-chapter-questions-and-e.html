            <li>One of your friends plans to return to the family alfalfa farm in central California after college and has an idea to export a compressed form of alfalfa (alfalfa pellets) to be used as high-quality animal feed. Your friend knows that you are studying international business and has asked you for guidance. Prepare a summary for your friend of the issues that need to be considered; you can consult the “A Basic Guide to Exporting” series of webinars found on the globalEDGE website (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://globaledge.msu.edu">http://globaledge.msu.edu</a>). What other resources did you find helpful?</li>
            <li>You like international business so much that you are inspired to start up an international business club at your school. While some of your classmates share this interest, you would like to start the club with strong membership numbers. Your teacher has agreed to give you ten minutes at the start of the next class to introduce your club idea and build support for it. You think that you can also use this presentation to build awareness of international business among students who might really enjoy the class and the topic if they knew more about it. Develop a ten-minute presentation that explains why you are passionate about international business, what international business people do, and what types of organizations are involved in international business.</li>
            <li>You are browsing YouTube and come across the video “RMIT Business—International Business” (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmaBDalFsU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmaBDalFsU</a>). You share this video with your international business instructor. She is so impressed by the video that she asks you to develop a two- to three-minute video for your class that can be posted on YouTube as well. Adapt your presentation from Exercise 2 into a YouTube production and share it with your class.</li>

            <li>In <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch01_s05#fwk-168388-ch01_s05">Section 1.5 "Ethics and International Business"</a>, under the subhead “What Ethics Is Not,” you read the statement “Ethics is not following culturally accepted norms.” This is a tough statement as many argue that ethics is impacted by cultural values. What are some examples of culturally accepted norms from one country that challenge the ethical beliefs in another?</li>
            <li>Giving gifts is an accepted and legal tradition in the Japanese business setting but is discouraged (and in some cases illegal) in the US business setting. Does this difference affect the competitive advantage of Japanese firms doing business in the United States or US firms doing business in Japan?</li>
