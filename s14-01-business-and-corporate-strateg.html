        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch02_s01_s01_p01">A strategy is the central, integrated, externally oriented concept of how a firm will achieve its objectives. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Strategy formulation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of deciding what to do; also called <em class="emphasis">strategizing</em>.</span></span> (or simply <em class="emphasis">strategizing</em>) is the process of deciding what to do; <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategy implementation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of performing all the activities necessary to do what has been planned.</span></span> is the process of performing all the activities necessary to do what has been planned. Neither can succeed without the other; the two processes are interdependent from the standpoint that implementation should provide information that is used to periodically modify the strategy. However, it’s important to distinguish between the two because, typically, different people are involved in each process. In general, the leaders of the organization formulate strategy, while everyone is responsible for strategy implementation.</p>

The general distinction is that business strategy addresses <em class="emphasis">how we should compete</em>, while corporate strategy is concerned with <em class="emphasis">in which businesses we should compete</em>. Specifically, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business strategy</a><span class="glossdef">The ways a firm goes about achieving its objectives within a particular business.</span></span> refers to the ways in which a firm plans to achieve its objectives within a particular business. In other words, one of Splash Corporation’s business strategies would address its objectives within the nutraceuticals business. This strategy may focus on such things as how it competes against multinationals, including Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble. Similarly, Walmart managers are engaged in business strategy when they decide how to compete with Sears for consumer dollars.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch02_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">In what businesses will we compete?</strong> The Hortalezas, for instance, say that they are in the wellness business; but from the opening case, you can see that they’re talking about specific niche markets related to wellness.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How can we, as a corporate parent, add value to our various lines of business (often called subsidiaries)?</strong> For example, Splash’s senior management might be able to orchestrate synergies and learning by using new products coming out of the Splash Research Institute. It can also glean market intelligence through health and beauty care retail outlets. Market intelligence can give Splash information on which brands are selling well, and some of those brands might be good targets for Splash to acquire, such as it did with the Hygienix brand line. Hygienix is a brand line of antibacterial skin-care products. Corporate strategy deals with finding ways to create value by having two or more owned businesses cooperate and share resources.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How can diversifying our business or entering a new industry, help us compete in our other industries?</strong> The Hortalezas’ experience with the HBC retailers can provide valuable insights into which new products to develop through the Splash Research Institute; in addition, Splash can sell more of its own products through HBC outlets.</li>

The different types of international strategy are reviewed in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch02_s03#fwk-168388-ch02_s03">Section 10.3 "International Strategy"</a>. Even when a firm doesn’t sell products or services outside its home country, its international strategy can include importing, international outsourcing, or offshoring. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Importing</a><span class="glossdef">The sale of products or services in one country that are sourced in another country.</span></span> involves the sale of products or services in one country that are sourced in another country. Penzeys Spices, for instance, sells herbs and spices that it buys from all over the world, yet it has retail outlets in only twenty-three states. However, such activity is not limited to small companies like Penzeys. Kohl’s Corporation, one of the largest discount retailers in the country, has stores exclusively in the United States but most of its products are sourced overseas. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">Contracting with a third party to do some of a company’s work on its behalf.</span></span>, the company delegates an entire process (e.g., accounts payable) to the outsource vendor. The vendor takes control of the operation and runs the operation as it sees fit. The company pays the outsource vendor for the end result; how the vendor achieves those end results is up to the vendor. The outsourcer may do the work within the same country or may take it to another country (also known as offshoring). In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">offshoring</a><span class="glossdef">Taking some business function out of the company’s country of orgin to be performed in another country, generally at a lower cost.</span></span>, the company takes a function out of its home country and places the function in another country, generally at a lower cost. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">International outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">Outsourcing to to a nondomestic third party.</span></span> refers to work that is contracted to a nondomestic third party.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch02_s01_s02_p01">From where does strategy originate? Strategy formulation typically comes from the top managers or owners of an organization, while the responsibility for strategy implementation resides with all organizational members. This entire set of activities is called the strategizing process, as summarized in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-168388-ch02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 10.2</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch02_s01_s02_p02">As you can see with the opening case on Splash Corporation, the strategizing process starts with an organization’s mission and vision. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mission statement</a><span class="glossdef">An organization’s statement of purpose that describes who the company is and what it does</span></span> is the organization’s statement of purpose and describes who the company is and what it does.

This plan should allow for the achievement of the mission and vision.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch02_s01_s02_p04">Research suggests that companies from different countries approach strategy from different perspectives of social responsibility. Central to the distinctiveness of the Indian business model is the sense of mission, a social goal for the business that goes beyond making money and helps employees see a purpose in their work. Every company we [the researchers] saw articulated a clear social mission for their business. ITC, a leading conglomerate, echoed the views of the companies we interviewed with this statement, describing the company’s purpose: “Envisioning a larger societal purpose has always been a hallmark of ITC. The company sees no conflict between the twin goals of shareholder value enhancement and societal value creation.” Contrast this Indian model, where a company’s business goal is seen as bettering society, with the US model, where we try to motivate employees around the corporate goal of making shareholders rich. The US approach is at a sizable disadvantage, because it is difficult for most people to see making money for shareholders as a goal that is personally meaningful. While it is possible to tie pay to shareholder value, it is extremely expensive to pay the average employee enough in share-based incentives to get him or her to focus on shareholder value.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn02_007">Peter Cappelli, Harbir Singh, Jitendra Singh, and Michael Useem, “The India Way: Lessons for the U.S.,” <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Perspectives</em> 24, no. 2 (2010): 6–24.</span></p>

Andrews, <em class="emphasis">The Concept of Corporate Strategy</em> (Homewood, IL: Richard D. Irwin, 1971).</span> It is the assessment of a company’s strengths and weaknesses—the S and W—which occur as part of organizational analysis; this organizational analysis of S and W is an audit of a company’s internal workings. Conversely, examining the opportunities and threats is a part of environmental analysis—the company must look outside the organization to determine the opportunities and threats, over which it has less control. When conducting a SWOT analysis, a firm asks four basic questions about itself and its environment:</p>

Michael Jordan, for instance, is an excellent all-around athlete; he excels in baseball and golf, but his athletic skills show best in basketball. As with Jordan’s athleticism, when you can identify certain strengths that set an organization apart from actual and potential competitors, that strength is considered a source of competitive advantage. The hardest but most important thing for an organization to do is to develop its competitive advantage into a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sustainable competitive advantage</a><span class="glossdef">A situation where an organization’s strengths cannot be easily duplicated or imitated by other firms, nor made redundant or less valuable by changes in the external environment.</span></span>—that is, using the organization’s strengths in way a that can’t be easily duplicated by other firms or made less valuable by changes in the external environment.</p>

What opportunities exist in the market or the environment from which the organization can benefit? <em class="emphasis">Threats</em> include factors beyond your control that could place the strategy or even the business itself at risk.
