        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">PESTEL analysis</a><span class="glossdef">An important and widely used tool that helps present the big picture of a firm’s external environment in political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal contexts, particularly as related to foreign markets; analyzes for market growth or decline and, therefore, the position, potential, and direction for a business.</span></span> is an important and widely used tool that helps show the big picture of a firm’s external environment, particularly as related to foreign markets. PESTEL is an acronym for the political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal contexts in which a firm operates. A PESTEL analysis helps managers gain a better understanding of the opportunities and threats they face; consequently, the analysis aids in building a better vision of the future business landscape and how the firm might compete profitably. This useful tool analyzes for market growth or decline and, therefore, the position, potential, and direction for a business. When a firm is considering entry into new markets, these factors are of considerable importance. Moreover, PESTEL analysis provides insight into the status of key market <em class="emphasis">flatteners</em>, both in terms of their present state and future trends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_p02">Firms need to understand the macroenvironment to ensure that their strategy is aligned with the powerful forces of change affecting their business landscape. When firms exploit a change in the environment—rather than simply survive or oppose the change—they are more likely to be successful. A solid understanding of PESTEL also helps managers avoid strategies that may be doomed to fail given the circumstances of the environment. JCPenney’s failed entry into Chile is a case in point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_p03">Finally, understanding PESTEL is critical prior to entry into a new country or region. The fact that a strategy is congruent with PESTEL in the home environment gives no assurance that it will also align in other countries. For example, when Lands’ End, the online clothier, sought to expand its operations into Germany, it ran into local laws prohibiting it from offering unconditional guarantees on its products. In the United States, Lands’ End had built a reputation for quality on its no-questions-asked money-back guarantee. However, this was considered illegal under Germany’s regulations governing incentive offers and price discounts. The political skirmish between Lands’ End and the German government finally ended when the regulations banning unconditional guarantees were abolished. While the restrictive regulations didn’t put Lands’ End out of business in Germany, they did inhibit its growth there until the laws were abolished.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_p04">There are three steps in the PESTEL analysis. First, consider the relevance of each of the PESTEL factors to your context. Next, identify and categorize the information that applies to these factors. Finally, analyze the data and draw conclusions. Common mistakes in this analysis include stopping at the second step or assuming that the initial analysis and conclusions are correct without testing the assumptions and investigating alternative scenarios.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_p05">The framework for PESTEL analysis is presented below. It’s composed of six sections—one for each of the PESTEL headings.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_020">Mason Carpenter, Talya Bauer, and Berrin Erdogan, <em class="emphasis">Principles of Management</em> (Nyack, NY: <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>, 2009), accessed January 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/printed-book/127834">http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/printed-book/127834</a>.</span> The framework includes sample questions or prompts, the answers to which can help determine the nature of opportunities and threats in the macroenvironment. These questions are examples of the types of issues that can arise in a PESTEL analysis.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Political Factors</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p01">The political environment can have a significant influence on businesses. In addition, political factors affect consumer confidence and consumer and business spending. For instance, how stable is the political environment? This is particularly important for companies entering new markets. Government policies on regulation and taxation can vary from state to state and across national boundaries. Political considerations also encompass trade treaties, such as NAFTA, ASEAN, and EU. Such treaties tend to favor trade among the member countries but impose penalties or less favorable trade terms on nonmembers.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Factors</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p01">Managers also need to consider macroeconomic factors that will have near-term and long-term effects on the success of their strategy. Inflation rates, interest rates, tariffs, the growth of the local and foreign national economies, and exchange rates are critical. Unemployment, availability of critical labor, and the local cost of labor also have a strong bearing on strategy, particularly as related to the location of disparate business functions and facilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Sociocultural Factors</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s03_p01">The social and cultural influences on business vary from country to country. Depending on the type of business, factors such as the local languages, the dominant religions, the cultural views toward leisure time, and the age and lifespan demographics may be critical. Local sociocultural characteristics also include attitudes toward consumerism, environmentalism, and the roles of men and women in society. For example, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have grown in international markets due to the increasing level of consumerism outside the United States.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s03_p02">Making assumptions about local norms derived from experiences in your home market is a common cause for early failure when entering new markets. However, even home-market norms can change over time, often caused by shifting demographics due to immigration or aging populations.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Technological Factors</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s04_p01">The critical role of technology is discussed in more detail later in this section. For now, suffice it to say that technological factors have a major bearing on the threats and opportunities firms encounter. For example, new technology may make it possible for products and services to be made more cheaply and to a better standard of quality. New technology may also provide the opportunity for more innovative products and services, such as online stock trading and remote working. Such changes have the potential to change the face of the business landscape.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Environmental Factors</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s05_p01">The environment has long been a factor in firm strategy, primarily from the standpoint of access to raw materials. Increasingly, this factor is best viewed as both a direct and indirect cost for the firm.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s05_p02">Environmental factors are also evaluated on the footprint left by a firm on its respective surroundings. For consumer-product companies like PepsiCo, for instance, this can encompass the waste-management and organic-farming practices used in the countries where raw materials are obtained. Similarly, in consumer markets, it may refer to the degree to which packaging is biodegradable or recyclable.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s06_p01">Finally, legal factors reflect the laws and regulations relevant to the region and the organization. Legal factors can include whether the rule of law is well established, how easily or quickly laws and regulations may change, and what the costs of regulatory compliance are. For example, Coca-Cola’s market share in Europe is greater than 50 percent; as a result, regulators have asked that the company give shelf space in its coolers to competitive products in order to provide greater consumer choice.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_021">“EU Curbs Coca-Cola Market Dominance,” <em class="emphasis">Food &amp; Beverage Reporter</em>, August 2005, accessed February 18, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.developtechnology.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18464&amp;Itemid=101">http://www.developtechnology.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18464&amp;Itemid=101</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s01_s06_p02">Many of the PESTEL factors are interrelated. For instance, the legal environment is often related to the political environment, where laws and regulations can only change when they’re consistent with the political will.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s02_p01">Over the past decade, new markets have been opened to foreign competitors, whole industries have been deregulated, and state-run enterprises have been privatized. So, globalization has become a fact of life in almost every industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_022">George S. Yip, “Global Strategy in a World of Nations,” <em class="emphasis">Sloan Management Review</em> 31, no. 1 (1989): 29–40.</span> This entails much more than companies simply exporting products to another country. Some industries that aren’t normally considered global do, in fact, have strictly domestic players. But these companies often compete alongside firms with operations in multiple countries; in many cases, both sets of firms are doing equally well. In contrast, in a truly global industry, the core product is standardized, the marketing approach is relatively uniform, and competitive strategies are integrated in different international markets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_023">Michael E. Porter, <em class="emphasis">Competition in Global Industries</em> (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1986); George S. Yip, “Global Strategy in a World of Nations,” <em class="emphasis">Sloan Management Review</em> 31, no. 1 (1989): 29–40.</span> In these industries, competitive advantage clearly belongs to the firms that can compete globally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s02_p02">A number of factors reveal whether an industry has globalized or is in the process of globalizing.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p01">The more similar markets in different regions are, the greater the pressure for an industry to globalize. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, for example, are fairly uniform around the world because the demand for soft drinks is largely the same in every country. The airframe-manufacturing industry, dominated by Boeing and Airbus, also has a highly uniform market for its products; airlines all over the world have the same needs when it comes to large commercial jets.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s02_s02_p01">In both of these industries, costs favor globalization. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo realize economies of scope and scale because they make such huge investments in marketing and promotion. Since they’re promoting coherent images and brands, they can leverage their marketing dollars around the world. Similarly, Boeing and Airbus can invest millions in new-product R&amp;D only because the global market for their products is so large.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Governments and Competition</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s02_s03_p01">Obviously, favorable trade policies encourage the globalization of markets and industries. Governments, however, can also play a critical role in globalization by determining and regulating technological standards. Railroad gauge—the distance between the two steel tracks—would seem to favor a simple technological standard. In Spain, however, the gauge is wider than in France. Why? Because back in the 1850s, when Spain and neighboring France were hostile to one another, the Spanish government decided that making Spanish railways incompatible with French railways would hinder any French invasion.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s02_s03_p02">These are a few key drivers of industry change. However, there are particular implications of technological and business-model breakthroughs for both the pace and extent of industry change. The <em class="emphasis">rate</em> of change may vary significantly from one industry to the next; for instance, the computing industry changes much faster than the steel industry. Nevertheless, change in both fields has prompted complete reconfigurations of industry structure and the competitive positions of various players. The idea that all industries change over time and that business environments are in a constant state of flux is relatively intuitive. As a strategic decision maker, you need to ask yourself this question: how accurately does current industry structure (which is relatively easy to identify) predict future industry conditions?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Importing as a Stealth Form of Internationalization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Ironically, the drivers of globalization have also given rise to a greater level of imports. Globalization in this sense is a very strong flattener. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Importing</a><span class="glossdef">The sale of products or services in one country that are sourced in another country.</span></span> involves the sale of products or services in one country that are sourced in another country. In many ways, importing is a stealth form of internationalization. Firms often claim that they have no international operations and yet—directly or indirectly—base their production or services on inputs obtained from outside their home country. Firms that engage in importing must learn about customs requirements, informed compliance with customs regulations, entry of goods, invoices, classification and value, determination and assessment of duty, special requirements, fraud, marketing, trade finance and insurance, and foreign trade zones. Importing can take many forms—from the sourcing of components, machinery, and raw materials to the purchase of finished goods for domestic resale and the outsourcing of production or services to nondomestic providers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">Contracting with a third party to do some of a company’s work on its behalf.</span></span> occurs when a company contracts with a third party to do some work on its behalf.

But it’s not a new phenomenon; for decades, Nike has been designing shoes and other apparel that are manufactured abroad. Similarly, Pacific Cycle doesn’t make a single Schwinn or Mongoose bicycle in the United States but instead imports them entirely from manufacturers in Taiwan and China. It may seem as if international outsourcing is new because businesses are now more often outsourcing services, components, and raw materials from countries with developing economies (e.g., China, Brazil, and India).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s03_p03">In addition to factors of production, information technologies (IT)—such as telecommunications and the widespread diffusion of the Internet—have provided the impetus for outsourcing services. Business-process outsourcing (BPO) is the delegation of one or more IT-intensive business processes to an external provider that in turn owns, administers, and manages the selected process on the basis of defined and measurable performance criteria. The firms in service and IT-intensive industries—insurance, banking, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, automotive, and airlines—are among the early adopters of BPO. Of these, insurance and banking are able to generate the bulk of the savings, purely because of the large proportion of processes that they can outsource (i.e., the processing of claims and loans and providing service through call centers). Among those countries housing BPO operations, India experienced the most dramatic growth in services where language skills and education were important. Research firm Gartner anticipates that the BPO market in India will reach $1.8 billion by 2013.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_026">“Indian BPO Market to Grow 25 percent in 2010,” <em class="emphasis">Times of India</em>, March 29, 2010, accessed February 17, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Indian-BPO-market-to-grow-25-in-2010/articleshow/5739043.cms">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Indian-BPO-market-to-grow-25-in-2010/articleshow/5739043.cms</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s02_s03_p04">Generally, foreign outsourcing locations tend to be defined by how automated a production process or service can be made and the transportation costs involved. When transportation costs and automation are both high, then the knowledge worker component of the location calculation becomes less important. You can see how you might employ the CAGE framework to evaluate potential outsourcing locations. In some cases, though, firms invest in both plant equipment and the training and development of the local workforce. This becomes important when the broader labor force needs to have a higher level of education to operate complex plant machinery or because a firm’s specific technologies also have a cultural component. Brazil is one case in point; Ford, BMW, Daimler, and Cargill have all made significant investments in the educational infrastructure of this significant, emerging economy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_027">Spencer E.
