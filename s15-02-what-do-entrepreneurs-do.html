        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s01_p01">Entrepreneurs build for-profit and nonprofit ventures. The most well-known type of enterpreneurial venture is the for-profit, or commercial, venture, which sells products or services for a profit. Entrepreneurs can also launch a nonprofit venture whose purpose is to fulfill a social mission rather than to make money. For example, nonprofits often work to improve societal issues such as health care, the environment, and underserved populations. Entrepreneurs who launch these kinds of nonprofit ventures are often referred to as social entrepreneurs. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social entrepreneurs</a><span class="glossdef">A person who founds an organization (either for-profit or nonprofit) whose focus is to implement innovative solutions to societal problems.

Social entrepreneurs apply the same tools and skill sets as other entrepreneurs—seizing opportunities, organizing and managing tasks and people, improving how something is done—but their focus is to solve a social problem or create a benefit to humanity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s02_p01">There are three essential parts of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entrepreneurial process</a><span class="glossdef">Consists of (1) identifying entrepreneurial opportunities, (2) planning and preparing the venture, and (3) resourcing the venture and taking action.</span></span>: (1) opportunity identification, (2) plan and prepare the venture, and (3) resource the venture and take action. Sometimes the process unfolds as depicted in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 11.1 "The Entrepreneurial Process"</a>, though there are many examples where a formal plan is never put forth, or where a plan and resources lead to the identification of a completely different opportunity. 3M’s Post-it self-adhesive notes or W. L. Gore’s Glide dental floss are examples of the latter scenario.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_027">“Inventor of the Week: Robert Gore,” MIT School of Engineering, September 2006, accessed May 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/gore.html">http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/gore.html</a>.</span> However, for simplicity, you’ll look at the process in the common 1-2-3 order of identifying the opportunity, planning the venture, and funding and staffing it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Perhaps the biggest difference between strategy in existing firms and new ventures is the starting point. Most researchers agree that the starting point for new ventures is opportunity, while the strategy for existing firms usually begins with some assessment of the firm’s underlying resources and capabilities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_028">Jonathan T. Eckhardt and Scott A. Shane, “Opportunities and Entrepreneurship,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management</em> 29, no. 3 (June 2003): 333–49; Jonathan T. Eckhardt and Scott A. Shane, “The Individual-Opportunity Nexus: A New Perspective on Entrepreneurship,” in <em class="emphasis">Handbook of Entrepreneurship Research: An Interdisciplinary Survey and Introduction</em>, ed.

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Do People Find Opportunities?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s01_p01">You might be surprised to learn that you already possess at least two tools that might help you unearth a valuable business opportunity. One way to think about opportunities is through a tool shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s01_f01">Figure 11.2 "Levers That Lead to Opportunity Identification"</a>. The first four levers—eliminate, reduce, create, and raise—are summarized in the Blue Ocean Strategy framework made popular by strategy researchers W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_029">W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, “Blue Ocean Strategy: From Theory to Practice,” <em class="emphasis">California Management Review</em> 47, no. 3 (Spring 2005): 105–21.</span> The fifth characteristic was developed through the work of their colleagues, Mason Carpenter and W. Gerry Sanders, authors of the best-selling textbook <em class="emphasis">Strategic Management: A Dynamic Perspective</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_030">Mason Carpenter and William G. Sanders, <em class="emphasis">Strategic Management: A Dynamic Perspective, Concepts and Cases</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2009).</span> The general idea behind the first four changes is that an entrepreneurial opportunity will offer something new but not necessarily because it is simply adding more features or costs. For instance, Amazon became successful because it provided a greater selection of books than any other store on the planet (increase), allowed greater convenience when shopping for books (reduced time needed), developed a logistics and software infrastructure to manage the process (create/add), and threatened to make brick-and-mortar stores obsolete (eliminate).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s01_p02">New markets can be created when innovations are based on these four characteristics alone. However, experience has shown that the more customers need to change their behaviors, the more slowly they will adopt an innovation. For this reason, the fifth characteristic—what stays the same—becomes a differentiating factor between innovations that take hold and those that don’t or do so more slowly. For instance, e-books have taken a long time to gain adoption, even though there are an increasing number of ways for them to be purchased and read. In contrast, Amazon’s strategy of selling printed books through an online store has worked largely because the book—the basic product—remained unchanged and thus required less change on the part of the consumer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s01_p03">Research suggests that new venture opportunities tend to fall into one of three categories—new-market disruptions, low-end disruptions, or hybrid.</p>

For instance, the automobile was a disruptive technology for the horse-and-buggy; CD players and MP3 players were disruptive technologies for the phonograph, or record player; and the computer was a disruptive technology for the typewriter. Some disruptive technologies appear at the low end of an industry offering and are referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">low-end disruptions</a><span class="glossdef">A disruptive technology that appears at the low end of an industry offering and usually does not lure customers away until it improves and becomes better than the incumbent offering.</span></span>. Current players tend to ignore such new entrants because they target the least valuable of their customers. These low-end disruptions rarely offer features that satisfy the best customers in the industry. In fact, the new low-end disruptive technologies usually perform worse than the existing technology at first.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_031">Clayton Christensen, <em class="emphasis">The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> (New York: HarperBusiness, 2000), xv.</span> For example, early automobiles were less reliable than the horse-and-buggy until improvements made them vastly better. New entrants often use low-end entry to gain a foothold to move into the attractive market once their products or services improve. Indeed, by the time they do improve, these low-end disruptions often satisfy the needs of the center of the market better than incumbents’ products do, because the new entrants have been making incremental improvements to satisfy their best clients’ demands. Southwest Airlines began as a very successful low-end disrupter, satisfying only the most basic travel needs and eliminating many services that had been taken for granted by established airlines. Over time, Southwest’s offerings improved, and its on-time arrival percentage and customer service became the best in the industry. As a result, Southwest Airlines now appeals to more than just low-end customers.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p01">As you might expect, most newcomers adopt some combination of new-market and low-end disruption strategies; these are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hybrid-disruption strategies</a><span class="glossdef">A combination of new-market and low-end disruption strategies.</span></span>. Today, it may look as if Amazon has pursued a single-minded, low-end disruption strategy, but along the way, it has also created some new markets, mainly by bringing more buyers into the market for books. Many Amazon customers buy in the quantities they do because of the information that the site makes available. The strategies of such companies as JetBlue, Charles Schwab, and the University of Phoenix are also hybrids of new-market and low-cost disruption strategies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_032">These examples are drawn from an extensive and detailed list provided by Clayton M. Christensen and Michael E. Raynor, <em class="emphasis">The Innovator’s Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth</em> (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2003).</span> JetBlue’s focused, low-cost strategy, for instance, has been able to achieve the lowest cost position in the industry by eliminating many services (a business model it borrowed from Southwest). However, it has also targeted overpriced but underserved markets, thereby stimulating net new demand. Thus, JetBlue has both taken a portion of the existing market and created a new market by attracting consumers who couldn’t ordinarily afford air travel. Schwab is another example; it pioneered discount brokerage as a new market but has since captured many clients from full-service brokers, such as Merrill Lynch. The University of Phoenix is taking a strategic path in higher education much like the one blazed by Schwab in the investment market.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p02">All three of these disruption strategies provide you with a solid basis for identifying market opportunities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p03">Under all these strategies, an entrepreneur identifies an opportunity and then seeks to cobble together the resources and opportunities to exploit it. Individuals in close contact with scientific breakthroughs can also identify opportunities. In fact, scientific, technological, or process discoveries often inspire people to seek market opportunities. This is one reason why universities are increasing investments to support research faculty in the protection of intellectual property and identification of commercial opportunities. The University of Wisconsin–Madison, for instance, maintains its Office of Corporate Relations, which, among other services, assists individual researchers in the creation of new ventures. After all, faculty and staff members who create early-stage technology are often in the best position to develop it. Not only do they possess unsurpassed technical knowledge about their discoveries, but they’re also in a position to appreciate the promise that they hold.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s04_p01">In order to secure start-up financing and launch the new product, many entrepreneurs draw up a formal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business plan</a><span class="glossdef">A formal statement of a set of business goals, the reasons why they are believed attainable, and the plan for reaching those goals; it may also contain background information about the organization or team attempting to reach those goals.</span></span> that brings all the elements of the new venture together for a specific purpose—namely, to ensure key stakeholders that the firm has a well-considered strategy and managerial expertise. A business plan is a formal statement of business goals, the reasons why they are attainable, and the plan for reaching those goals. It may also contain background information about the organization or team attempting to reach the goals. Even if such a plan isn’t necessary for communicating with external stakeholders, preparing one is still a good idea. At the very least, it will help you reexamine the five elements of your strategy and prompt you to look for ways to bring them together in order to create a viable and profitable firm. In addition, a business plan provides a vehicle for sharing your goals and objectives—and your plans for implementing them—with members of your entrepreneurial team. Focusing on the staging component of the five elements of strategy, for example, is a good way to set milestones and timelines and otherwise manage the scale and pace of your company’s growth. Finally, when it does come time to seek external funding to support the firm’s growth, the plan provides a solid basis for engaging professionals who can both help you get financing and advise you on strengthening customer relationships and finding strategic suppliers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s04_p02">Familiarity with the five elements of strategy, implementation levers, and frameworks for analyzing external organizational context can prepare you to draw up a business plan. Although there are variations on form, the content of most plans covers the same topics. You can find a multitude of examples on the web in addition to software packages for creating a detailed and professional-looking document.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_033">See, for example, Business Plans website, accessed November 1, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bplans.com">http://www.bplans.com</a>; U.S. Small Business Administration website, accessed November 1, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/starting-managing-business/starting-business/writing-business-plan">http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/starting-managing-business/starting-business/writing-business-plan</a>; More Business website, accessed November 1, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.morebusiness.com">http://www.morebusiness.com</a>; Center for Business Planning website, accessed November 1, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessplans.org">http://www.businessplans.org</a>.</span> For more information, see the sidebar below for a summary of what is normally contained in a comprehensive business plan.</p>

This section stresses the business concept and not the numbers. It’s the unique value proposition and business model that really matters.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Company description.</strong> This short section describes the company’s business, form of organization, location, structure, and strategy. It provides a summary of the company’s capabilities and its goals and plans for the next five years.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Products and services.</strong> This overview explains what products or services the company will sell; it also discusses why customers will want the products or services, what problems the offerings will solve and what benefits they will deliver, and how much customers are likely to pay for them (i.e., the willingness-to-pay criteria).</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Market analysis.</strong> This section identifies the need or demand for the product, who the target customers will be, and why the customers will buy the product. The section also includes a discussion of the company’s competitors or potential competitors, and why the product or service will have a competitive advantage over similar offerings from competitors. It also addresses the barriers to entry in this market that may prevent the entry of new competitors, such as high capital costs, difficulty in reaching customers or persuading them to switch loyalties, hard-to-get employee skills, and so forth.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Proprietary position.</strong> If the new venture will rely on patents or licenses to patents, this section discusses how these patents will contribute to the company’s competitive position and assesses whether other patents (i.e., competitors or otherwise) might limit the company’s ability to market its products. If similar products don’t already exist, it discusses the alternative means by which customers are likely to meet the needs the product addresses.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Marketing and sales plan.</strong> This part shows how the company plans to attract and maintain customers and discusses product pricing promotion and positioning strategy.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Management team.</strong> The plan also describes the members of the management team, emphasizing its track record at accomplishing tasks similar to those the company will face. Investors view the management team as the most important asset that will lead to company growth and help respond to unexpected changes.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Operations plan.</strong> Next, the plan describes how the business will operate on a day-to-day basis, explaining how the key assets (labor, processes, and tools) will be used to produce and deliver the products and services. This section includes a description of where the company will be located and where it will do business.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Finances.</strong> This section identifies the capital that will be required to build the business and how it will be used. It includes projections of revenues and expenses that show investors how they will get their money back and what return they can expect on their investment.</li>

Needless to say, however, a well-crafted plan doesn’t ensure a successful business. At this point in the process, your probability of success depends more heavily on the strength of the three elements with which you started the process—a good opportunity (including the right timing), the right entrepreneurial team, and the necessary resources and capabilities. A business plan is no substitute for strategy and strong execution. That’s why consultants often suggest that entrepreneurs think of the business plan not only as a helpful and necessary starting point but also as a continuous work in progress.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_034">Jeffry A.

Sometimes, as you might imagine, key people are among the intangible resources and capabilities that distinguish the potential new venture as an opportunity, rather than just another good idea. As a practical matter, it’s the entrepreneur who drives the entrepreneurial process and ensures that all three elements—opportunity, resources and capabilities, and people—are in place and balanced. Because individuals have limits, team members are often selected because they bring skills that complement those of the lead entrepreneur and ensure that the firm has the necessary human capital to achieve its objectives.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Money</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s05_s01_p01">Beyond the opportunity and the people, most entrepreneurs would identify money and access to money as one of the scarcest resources. The financing activity of the new venture can take many forms with sources ranging from credit cards to venture capitalists to banks. You might expect most successful ventures to have access to adequate capital, but you’d be surprised. In fact, many successful entrepreneurs (and their investors) suspect that too much money too early does more damage than good.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_035">Jeffry A. Timmons, <em class="emphasis">New Venture Creation: Entrepreneurship for the 21st Century</em>, 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1999); Amar V. Bhide, “Bootstrap Finance: The Art of Start-Ups,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, 70, no. 66 (November–December 1992): 109–17.</span> How can excess cash possibly be a problem? Remember, first of all, that financing rarely comes without strings attached. Entrepreneurs who depend on significant cash flow from loans or investor capital often find that their flexibility is considerably reduced. Second, ample funding can obscure potential problems until the consequences are irreversible.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s05_s01_p02">Perhaps most importantly, deep financial pockets shelter the new firm from the need to innovate in all aspects of its business. For example, the best new opportunities are often created by firms that have both new ideas and new, sometimes less costly ways to put those ideas work. Dell’s sustained dominance in the personal computer (PC) market, for instance, can be credited to the combination of a new direct-sales model (a new-market opportunity using catalogs and then the Internet) and the direct manufacturing model (a cheaper way of putting together the equipment sold through direct means) that it fostered. Similarly, Amazon’s prowess is equally a function of its introduction of an online book business (again, a new opportunity) and the patented online logistical expertise that the company developed to put the idea into practice (i.e., a cheaper way to merchandise).</p>

Flat World is the first company to successfully seize the opportunity to develop leading-edge college textbooks and provide them simultaneously in online, portable electronic, and print-on-demand formats. Flat World has a much less costly structure per book category than competitors because it provides one title in broad categories such as principles of management, international business, entrepreneurship, marketing, and accounting. In contrast, traditional textbook publishers may have ten to fifteen titles in these categories, hoping that many small slices of the market will add up to big revenues—albeit at a much higher cost per category than what is experienced by <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>.</p>

A lot of new ventures are bootstrapped; a recent study of the five hundred fastest-growing small companies in the United States found median start-up capital to be around $20,000 in real terms.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_036">Amar V. Bhide, “Bootstrap Finance: The Art of Start-Ups,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, 70, no. 66 (November–December 1992): 109–17.</span> Ironically, the fastest-growing firms typically require the most money because they have to support increases in inventories, accounts receivable, staffing, and production and service facilities. The most common form of bootstrapping is simply to use a personal credit card and then pay off the incurred debt. Despite the risk that taking on personal debt has, founders may opt for this method because it gives them more freedom to grow the company their own way and not have to share any equity. Many successful companies, including Dell, were founded this way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s05_s01_p05">There are different types of bootstrapping, including the following:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn03_037">Jay Ebbens and Alec Johnson, “Bootstrapping in Small Firms: An Empirical Analysis of Change over Time,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Venturing</em> 21, no. 6 (November 2006): 851–65.</span></p>

Entrepreneurs will bring in outside investors if they need a larger sum of capital than they can obtain through personal credit cards or second mortgages. In addition, outside investors can bring useful contacts, experience and accountability to the new venture. Outsiders can range from individuals like <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">angel investors</a><span class="glossdef">An affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up.</span></span> to professionals like <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">venture capitalists</a><span class="glossdef">A person or investment firm that makes venture investments and brings managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments.</span></span>, insurance companies, and public and private pension funds.</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s05_s02_p02">There is no substitute for action. Until you form the company and attempt to land your first partners and customers, all you really have is a paper-napkin idea. I hate to break it to you, but this country’s chock full of paper napkins. It’s short on people who will believe in themselves and give it a try. You’ll be surprised how much and how quickly you learn once the company’s up and running.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch03_s02_s05_s02_p03">It’s important to note that this bias for action relates to activities guided by the business plan or core idea. The plan helps the entrepreneur make choices that make things happen, revise assumptions, and make midcourse corrections in light of new information. Without action, however, there will be no new sources of information to inform these latter parts of the entrepreneurial process.</p>
