            <li>How are economies classified?</li>
            <li>What is the developed world?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_p01">From the title of this chapter, you may be wondering—is this chapter going to cover the world? And, in a sense, the answer is yes. When global managers explore how to expand, they start by looking at the world. Knowing the major markets and the stage of development for each allows managers to determine how best to enter and expand. The manager’s goal is to hone in on a new country—hopefully, before their competitors and usually before the popular media does. China and India were expanding rapidly for several years before the financial press, such as the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, elevated them to their current hot status.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_p02">It’s common to find people interested in doing business with a country simply because they’ve read that it’s the new “hot” economy. They may know little or nothing about the market or country—its history, evolution of thought, people, or how interactions are generally managed in a business or social context. Historically, many companies have only looked at new global markets once potential customers or partners have approached them. However, trade barriers are falling, and new opportunities are fast emerging in markets of the Middle East and Africa—further flattening the world for global firms. Companies are increasingly identifying these and other global markets for their products and services and incorporating them into their long-term growth strategies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_p03">Savvy global managers realize that to be effective in a country, they need to know its recent political, economic, and social history. This helps them evaluate not only the current business opportunity but also the risk of political, economic, and social changes that can impact their business. First, <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s01#fwk-168388-ch09_s01">Section 4.1 "Classifying World Economies"</a> outlines how businesses and economists evaluate world economies. Then, the remaining sections review what developed and developing worlds are and how they differ, as well as explain how to evaluate the expanding set of emerging-market countries, which started with the BRIC countries (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and has now expanded to include twenty-eight countries. Effective global managers need to be able to identify the markets that offer the best opportunities for their products and services. Additionally, managers need to monitor these emerging markets for new local companies that take advantage of business conditions to become global competitors.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p01">India and China are among the world’s fastest-growing economies, contributing nearly 30 percent to global economic growth. Both China and India are not emerging economies—they’re actually “re-emerging,” having spent centuries at the center of trade throughout history: “These two Asian giants, which until 1800 used to make up half the world economy, are not, like Japan and Germany, mere nation states. In terms of size and population, each is a continent—and for all the glittering growth rates, a poor one.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_001">“Contest of the Century,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, August 19, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/node/16846256">http://www.economist.com/node/16846256</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p02">Both India and China are in fierce competition with each other as well as in their quest to catch up with the major economies in the developed world. Each have particular strengths and competitive advantages that have allowed each of them to weather the recent global financial crisis better than most countries. China’s growth has been mainly investment and export driven, focusing on low-cost manufacturing, with domestic consumption as low as 36 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). On the other hand, India’s growth has been derived mostly from a strong services sector and buoyant domestic consumption. India is also much less dependent on trade than China, relying on external trade for about 20 percent of its GDP versus 56 percent for China. The Chinese economy has doubled every eight years for the last three decades—the fastest rate for a major economy in recorded history. By 2011, China is the world’s second largest economy in the world behind the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_002">Gopal Ethiraj, “China Edges Out Japan to Become World’s No. 2 Economy,” <em class="emphasis">Asian Tribune</em>, August 18, 2010, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/08/18/china-edges-out-japan-become-world%E2%80%99s-no-2-economy">http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/08/18/china-edges-out-japan-become-world%E2%80%99s-no-2-economy</a>.</span> A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that China could overtake the US economy as early as 2020.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_003">Suzanne Rosselet, “Strengths of China and India to Take Them into League of Developing Countries,” <em class="emphasis">Economic Times</em>, May 7, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/corporate-dossier/Strengths-of-China-and-India-to-take-them-into-league-of-developing-countries/articleshow/5900893.cms">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/corporate-dossier/Strengths-of-China-and-India-to-take-them-into-league-of-developing-countries/articleshow/5900893.cms</a>.</span></p>

China’s fast-acting government implements new policies with blinding speed, making India’s fractured political system appear sluggish and chaotic. Beijing’s shiny new airport and wide freeways are models of modern development, contrasting sharply with the sagging infrastructure of New Delhi and Mumbai. And as the global economy emerges from the Great Recession, India once again seems to be playing second fiddle.

China then hurtled so far ahead that it seemed India could never catch up. But India’s long-term prospects now look stronger. While China is about to see its working-age population shrink, India is enjoying the sort of bulge in manpower which brought sustained booms elsewhere in Asia. It is no longer inconceivable that its growth could outpace China’s for a considerable time. It has the advantage of democracy—at least as a pressure valve for discontent. And India’s army is, in numbers, second only to China’s and America’s…And because India does not threaten the West, it has powerful friends both on its own merits and as a counterweight to China.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_007">“Contest of the Century,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, August 19, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/node/16846256">http://www.economist.com/node/16846256</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p08">Since 1978, China’s economic growth and reform have dramatically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese, increased social mobility. The Chinese leadership has reduced the role of ideology in economic policy by adopting a more pragmatic perspective on many political and socioeconomic problems. China’s ongoing economic transformation has had a profound impact not only on China but on the world. The market-oriented reforms China has implemented over the past two decades have unleashed individual initiative and entrepreneurship. The result has been the largest reduction of poverty and one of the fastest increases in income levels ever seen.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p10">India’s economic liberalization in 1991 opened gates to businesses worldwide. In the mid- to late 1980s, Rajiv Gandhi’s government eased restrictions on capacity expansion, removed price controls, and reduced corporate taxes. While his government viewed liberalizing the economy as a positive step, political pressures slowed the implementation of policies. The early reforms increased the rate of growth but also led to high fiscal deficits and a worsening current account. India’s major trading partner then, the Soviet Union, collapsed. In addition, the first Gulf War in 1991 caused oil prices to increase, which in turn led to a major balance-of-payments crisis for India. To be able to cope with these problems, the newly elected Prime Minister Narasimha Rao along with Finance Minister Manmohan Singh initiated a widespread economic liberalization in 1991 that is widely credited with what has led to the Indian economic engine of today. Focusing on the barriers for private sector investment and growth, the reforms enabled faster approvals and began to dismantle the <em class="emphasis">License Raj</em>, a term dating back to India’s colonial historical administrative legacy from the British and referring to a complex system of regulations governing Indian businesses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_010">“Economic History of India,” History of India, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.indohistory.com/economic_history_of_india.html">http://www.indohistory.com/economic_history_of_india.html</a>.</span></p>

While India spends $17 per capita in capital investments in urban infrastructure annually, China spends $116. Indian cities have devolved little real power and accountability to its cities; but China’s major cities enjoy the same status as provinces and have powerful and empowered political appointees as mayors.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p16">So what markets are likely to benefit the most from these trends? In India, by 2025, the largest markets will be transportation and communication, food, and health care followed by housing and utilities, recreation, and education. Even India’s slower-growing spending categories will represent significant opportunities for businesses because these markets will still be growing rapidly in comparison with their counterparts in other parts of the world. In China’s cities today, the fastest-growing categories are likely to be transportation and communication, housing and utilities, personal products, health care, and recreation and education. In addition, in both China and India, urban infrastructure markets will be massive.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_019">Richard Dobbs and Shirish Sankhe, “Opinion: China vs. India,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, May 18, 2010, reprinted on McKinsey Global Institute website, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/mginews/opinion_china_vs_india.asp">http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/mginews/opinion_china_vs_india.asp</a>.</span></p>
