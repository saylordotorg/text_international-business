            <li>How are economies classified?</li>
            <li>What is the developed world?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_p01">From the title of this chapter, you may be wondering—is this chapter going to cover the world? And, in a sense, the answer is yes. When global managers explore how to expand, they start by looking at the world. Knowing the major markets and the stage of development for each allows managers to determine how best to enter and expand. The manager’s goal is to hone in on a new country—hopefully, before their competitors and usually before the popular media does. China and India were expanding rapidly for several years before the financial press, such as the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, elevated them to their current hot status.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_p02">It’s common to find people interested in doing business with a country simply because they’ve read that it’s the new “hot” economy. They may know little or nothing about the market or country—its history, evolution of thought, people, or how interactions are generally managed in a business or social context. Historically, many companies have only looked at new global markets once potential customers or partners have approached them. However, trade barriers are falling, and new opportunities are fast emerging in markets of the Middle East and Africa—further flattening the world for global firms. Companies are increasingly identifying these and other global markets for their products and services and incorporating them into their long-term growth strategies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_p03">Savvy global managers realize that to be effective in a country, they need to know its recent political, economic, and social history. This helps them evaluate not only the current business opportunity but also the risk of political, economic, and social changes that can impact their business. First, <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s01#fwk-168388-ch09_s01">Section 4.1 "Classifying World Economies"</a> outlines how businesses and economists evaluate world economies. Then, the remaining sections review what developed and developing worlds are and how they differ, as well as explain how to evaluate the expanding set of emerging-market countries, which started with the BRIC countries (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and has now expanded to include twenty-eight countries. Effective global managers need to be able to identify the markets that offer the best opportunities for their products and services. Additionally, managers need to monitor these emerging markets for new local companies that take advantage of business conditions to become global competitors.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p01">India and China are among the world’s fastest-growing economies, contributing nearly 30 percent to global economic growth. Both China and India are not emerging economies—they’re actually “re-emerging,” having spent centuries at the center of trade throughout history: “These two Asian giants, which until 1800 used to make up half the world economy, are not, like Japan and Germany, mere nation states. In terms of size and population, each is a continent—and for all the glittering growth rates, a poor one.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_001">“Contest of the Century,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, August 19, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/node/16846256">http://www.economist.com/node/16846256</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p02">Both India and China are in fierce competition with each other as well as in their quest to catch up with the major economies in the developed world. Each have particular strengths and competitive advantages that have allowed each of them to weather the recent global financial crisis better than most countries. China’s growth has been mainly investment and export driven, focusing on low-cost manufacturing, with domestic consumption as low as 36 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). On the other hand, India’s growth has been derived mostly from a strong services sector and buoyant domestic consumption. India is also much less dependent on trade than China, relying on external trade for about 20 percent of its GDP versus 56 percent for China. The Chinese economy has doubled every eight years for the last three decades—the fastest rate for a major economy in recorded history. By 2011, China is the world’s second largest economy in the world behind the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_002">Gopal Ethiraj, “China Edges Out Japan to Become World’s No. 2 Economy,” <em class="emphasis">Asian Tribune</em>, August 18, 2010, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/08/18/china-edges-out-japan-become-world%E2%80%99s-no-2-economy">http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/08/18/china-edges-out-japan-become-world%E2%80%99s-no-2-economy</a>.</span> A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that China could overtake the US economy as early as 2020.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_003">Suzanne Rosselet, “Strengths of China and India to Take Them into League of Developing Countries,” <em class="emphasis">Economic Times</em>, May 7, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/corporate-dossier/Strengths-of-China-and-India-to-take-them-into-league-of-developing-countries/articleshow/5900893.cms">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/corporate-dossier/Strengths-of-China-and-India-to-take-them-into-league-of-developing-countries/articleshow/5900893.cms</a>.</span></p>

China’s fast-acting government implements new policies with blinding speed, making India’s fractured political system appear sluggish and chaotic. Beijing’s shiny new airport and wide freeways are models of modern development, contrasting sharply with the sagging infrastructure of New Delhi and Mumbai. And as the global economy emerges from the Great Recession, India once again seems to be playing second fiddle.

China then hurtled so far ahead that it seemed India could never catch up. But India’s long-term prospects now look stronger. While China is about to see its working-age population shrink, India is enjoying the sort of bulge in manpower which brought sustained booms elsewhere in Asia. It is no longer inconceivable that its growth could outpace China’s for a considerable time. It has the advantage of democracy—at least as a pressure valve for discontent. And India’s army is, in numbers, second only to China’s and America’s…And because India does not threaten the West, it has powerful friends both on its own merits and as a counterweight to China.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_007">“Contest of the Century,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, August 19, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/node/16846256">http://www.economist.com/node/16846256</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p08">Since 1978, China’s economic growth and reform have dramatically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese, increased social mobility. The Chinese leadership has reduced the role of ideology in economic policy by adopting a more pragmatic perspective on many political and socioeconomic problems. China’s ongoing economic transformation has had a profound impact not only on China but on the world. The market-oriented reforms China has implemented over the past two decades have unleashed individual initiative and entrepreneurship. The result has been the largest reduction of poverty and one of the fastest increases in income levels ever seen.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s00_p10">India’s economic liberalization in 1991 opened gates to businesses worldwide. In the mid- to late 1980s, Rajiv Gandhi’s government eased restrictions on capacity expansion, removed price controls, and reduced corporate taxes. While his government viewed liberalizing the economy as a positive step, political pressures slowed the implementation of policies. The early reforms increased the rate of growth but also led to high fiscal deficits and a worsening current account. India’s major trading partner then, the Soviet Union, collapsed. In addition, the first Gulf War in 1991 caused oil prices to increase, which in turn led to a major balance-of-payments crisis for India. To be able to cope with these problems, the newly elected Prime Minister Narasimha Rao along with Finance Minister Manmohan Singh initiated a widespread economic liberalization in 1991 that is widely credited with what has led to the Indian economic engine of today. Focusing on the barriers for private sector investment and growth, the reforms enabled faster approvals and began to dismantle the <em class="emphasis">License Raj</em>, a term dating back to India’s colonial historical administrative legacy from the British and referring to a complex system of regulations governing Indian businesses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_010">“Economic History of India,” History of India, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.indohistory.com/economic_history_of_india.html">http://www.indohistory.com/economic_history_of_india.html</a>.</span></p>

While India spends $17 per capita in capital investments in urban infrastructure annually, China spends $116. Indian cities have devolved little real power and accountability to its cities; but China’s major cities enjoy the same status as provinces and have powerful and empowered political appointees as mayors.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s01_p01">Experts debate exactly how to define the level of economic development of a country—which criteria to use and, therefore, which countries are truly developed. This debate crosses political, economic, and social arguments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s01_p02">When evaluating a country, a manager is assessing the country’s income and the purchasing power of its people; the legal, regulatory, and commercial infrastructure, including communication, transportation, and energy; and the overall sophistication of the business environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s01_p03">Why does a country’s stage of development matter? Well, if you’re selling high-end luxury items, for example, you’ll want to focus on the per capita income of the local citizens. Can they afford a $1,000 designer handbag, a luxury car, or cutting-edge, high-tech gadgets? If so, how <em class="emphasis">many</em> people can afford these expensive items (i.e., how large is the domestic market)? For example, in January 2011, the <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em> quotes Jim O’Neill, a leading business economist, who states, “South Africa currently accounts for 0.6 percent of world GDP. South Africa can be successful, but it won’t be big.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_021">Jennifer Hughes, “‘Bric’ Creator Adds Newcomers to List,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, January 16, 2010, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f717c8e8-21be-11e0-9e3b-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1MKbbO8ET">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f717c8e8-21be-11e0-9e3b-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1MKbbO8ET</a>.</span> <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s04#fwk-168388-ch09_s04">Section 4.4 "Emerging Markets"</a> discusses the debate around the term <em class="emphasis">emerging markets</em> and which countries should be labeled as such. But clearly the size of the local market is an important key factor for businesspeople.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s01_p04">Even in developing countries, there are always wealthy people who want and can afford luxury items. But these consumers are just as likely to head to the developed world to make their purchase and have little concern about any duties or taxes they may have to pay when bringing the items back into their home country. This is one reason why companies pay special attention to understanding their global consumers as well as where and how these consumers purchase goods. Global managers also focus on understanding if a country’s target market is growing and by what rate. Countries like China and India caught the attention of global companies, because they had large populations that were eager for foreign goods and services but couldn’t afford them. As more people in each country acquired wealth, their buying appetites increased. The challenge is how to identify which consumers in which countries are likely to become new customers. Managers focus on globally standard statistics as one set of criteria to understand the stage of development of any country that they’re exploring for business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_022">“Global Economies,” <em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Global Business Multimedia Series</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2010).</span></p>

The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World Bank’s PPP project to calculate these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_023">US Central Intelligence Agency, “Country Comparison:GDP (PPP),” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook</em>, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html</a>.</span></p>

The methodology used imposes a penalty for inequality, such that the GDI falls when the achievement levels of both women and men in a country go down or when the disparity between their achievements increases. The greater the gender disparity in basic capabilities, the lower a country’s GDI compared with its HDI. The GDI is simply the HDI discounted, or adjusted downwards, for gender inequality.</p>

It evaluates progress in advancing women’s standing in political and economic forums. It examines the extent to which women and men are able to actively participate in economic and political life and take part in decision making.

                <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s02_s03_p08">If human development is about enlarging choices, poverty means that opportunities and choices most basic to human development are denied. Thus a person is not free to lead a long, healthy, and creative life and is denied access to a decent standard of living, freedom, dignity, self-respect and the respect of others. From a human development perspective, poverty means more than the lack of what is necessary for material well-being.</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s02_s03_p09">For policy-makers, the poverty of choices and opportunities is often more relevant than the poverty of income. The poverty of choices focuses on the causes of poverty and leads directly to strategies of empowerment and other actions to enhance opportunities for everyone. Recognizing the poverty of choices and opportunities implies that poverty must be addressed in all its dimensions, not income alone.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_027">UNDP, “The Human Poverty Index (HPI),” <em class="emphasis">Human Development Reports</em>, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/hpi">http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/hpi</a>.</span></p>

There are two different HPIs—one for developing countries (HPI-1) and another for a group of select high-income OECD (Organization for Economic and Development) countries (HPI-2), which better reflects the socioeconomic differences between the two groups.

Of course, one chapter can’t do justice to all of these markets, but through select examples, you’ll see how countries have evolved in the post–World War II global economic, political, and social environments. Remember that the goal of any successful businessperson is to monitor the changing markets and spot opportunities and trends ahead of his or her peers.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s03_p03">The major classifications used by analysts are evolving. The primary criteria for determining the stage of development may change within a decade as demonstrated with the addition of the gender and poverty indices. In addition, with every global crisis or event, there’s a tendency to add more acronyms and statistics into the mix. Savvy global managers have to sort through these to determine what’s relevant to their industry and their business objectives in one or more countries. For example, in the fall of 2010, after two years of global financial crisis, global investors started using a new acronym to describe the changing economic fortunes among countries: HIICs, or heavily indebted industrialized countries. These countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. “‘Developed markets are basically behaving like emerging markets,’ says HSBC’s Richard Yetsenga. ‘And emerging markets are quickly becoming more developed.’”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_029">Kelly Evans, “‘HIIC’ Nations Are Acting Like Backwaters,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 1, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704789404575524402059410506.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704789404575524402059410506.html</a>.</span> Investors are pulling money from the developed countries and into the BRIC countries (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, and China), which are “‘where the population growth is, where the raw materials are, and where the economic growth is,’ says Michael Penn, global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_030">Kelly Evans, “‘HIIC’ Nations Are Acting Like Backwaters,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 1, 2010, accessed January 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704789404575524402059410506.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704789404575524402059410506.html</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">The key here is to understand that classifications—just like countries and international business—are constantly evolving.</em></p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s03_p04">Rather than being overwhelmed by the evolving data, it’s critical to understand <em class="emphasis">why</em> the changes are occurring, <em class="emphasis">what</em> attitudes and perceptions are shifting, and <em class="emphasis">if</em> they are supported by real, verifiable data. In the above example of HIICs, investors from the major economies are likely motivated by quick gains on stock prices and the prevailing perception that emerging markets offer companies the best growth prospects. But as a businessperson, the timeline for your company would be in years, not months; so it’s important to evaluate information based on your company’s goals rather than relying on the media, investment markets, or other singularly focused industry professionals.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s03_p05">To truly monitor the global business arena and select prospective countries, you need to follow the news, trends, and available information for a period of time. Over time, savvy global managers develop a geographic, industrial, or product expertise—or some combination. Those who become experts on a specific country spend a great deal of time in the country, sometimes learn the language, and almost always develop an understanding of the country’s political, economic, and social history as well as its culture and evolution. They gain a deeper knowledge of more than just the country’s current business environment. In the business world, these folks are affectionately called “old hands”—as in he is an “old China hand” or an “old Indonesia hand.” This is a reflection of how seasoned or experienced a person is with a country.</p>

                <li>There are some classifications that are commonly used to define a stage of a country’s development. The GDP is the value of all the goods and services produced by a country in a single year. The income per person, a better indicator of the strength of the local economy and the market opportunity for a new consumer product, is the nominal per capita GDP—the GDP divided by the population of the country. Finally, to compare production and income across countries, economists adjust this number to reflect the different costs of living in specific countries. PPP adjusts the exchange rate between countries to ensure that a good is purchased for the same price in the same currency.</li>
                <li>The HDI measures people’s satisfaction in three key areas: (1) long and healthy life in terms of life expectancy; (2) access to quality education equally; and (3) a decent standard of living in the form of income. Health is measured by <em class="emphasis">life expectancy</em> at birth; knowledge is measured by a combination of the adult <em class="emphasis">literacy</em> rate and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio; and standard of living by <em class="emphasis">(income as measured by)</em> per capita GDP.</li>
                <li>Standards are constantly evolving to meet changing global scenarios; for instance, in 1997, the UNDP added the HPI to factor in the denial of basic opportunities and choices to those who live in poverty.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_p01">Many people are quick to focus on the developing economies and emerging markets as offering the brightest growth prospects. And indeed, this is often the case. However, you shouldn’t overlook the developed economies; they too can offer growth opportunities, depending on the specific product or service. The key is to understand what developed economies are and to determine their suitability for a company’s strategy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_p02">In essence, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">developed economies</a><span class="glossdef">Also known as advanced economies, these countries are characterized as postindustrial with high per capita incomes, competitive industries, transparent legal and regulatory environments, and well-developed commercial infrastructures.</span></span>, also known as advanced economies, are characterized as postindustrial countries—typically with a high per capita income, competitive industries, transparent legal and regulatory environments, and well-developed commercial infrastructure. Developed countries also tend to have high human development index (HDI) rankings—long life expectancies, high-quality health care, equal access to education, and high incomes. In addition, these countries often have democratically elected governments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_p03">In general, the developed world encompasses Canada, the United States, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. While these economies have moved from a manufacturing focus to a service orientation, they still have a solid manufacturing base. However, just because an economy is developed doesn’t mean that it’s among the largest economies. And, conversely, some of the world’s largest economies—while growing rapidly—don’t have competitive industries or transparent legal and regulatory environments. The infrastructure in these countries, while improving, isn’t yet consistent or substantial enough to handle the full base of business and consumer demand. Countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China—also known as BRIC—are hot emerging markets but are not yet considered developed by most widely accepted definitions. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s04#fwk-168388-ch09_s04">Section 4.4 "Emerging Markets"</a> covers the BRIC countries and other emerging markets.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The United States</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">Geographically, the United States is the fourth-largest country in the world—after Russia, China, and Canada. It sits in the middle of North America, bordered to the north by Canada and to the south by Mexico. With a history steeped in democratic and capitalist institutions, values and entrepreneurship, the United States has been the driver of the global economy since World War II.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p02">The US economy accounts for nearly 25 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP). Recently, the severe economic crisis and recession have led to double-digit unemployment and record deficits. Nevertheless, the United States remains a global economic engine, with an economy that is about twice as large as that of the next single country, China. With an annual GDP of more than $14 trillion, only the entire European Union can match the US economy in size. An economist’s proverb notes that when the US economy sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. Despite its massive wealth, 12 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_032">US Central Intelligence Agency, “North America: United States: Economy,” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook</em>, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p03">Throughout the cycles of growth and contractions, the US economy has a history of bouncing back relatively quickly. In recessions, the government and the business community tend to respond swiftly with measures to reduce costs and encourage growth. Americans often speak in terms of bull and bear markets. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bull market</a><span class="glossdef">A market in which prices rise for a prolonged period of time.</span></span> is one in which prices rise for a prolonged period of time, while a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bear market</a><span class="glossdef">A market in which prices steadily drop in a downward cycle.</span></span> is one in which prices steadily drop in a downward cycle.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p04">The strength of the US economy is due in large part to its diversity. Today, the United States has a service-based economy. In 2009, industry accounted for 21.9 percent of the GDP; services (including finance, insurance, and real estate) for 76.9 percent; and agriculture for 1.2 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_033">US Central Intelligence Agency, “North America: United States: Economy,” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook,</em> accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html</a>.</span> Manufacturing is a smaller component of the economy; however, the United States remains a major global manufacturer. The largest manufacturing sectors are highly diversified and technologically advanced—petroleum, steel, motor vehicles, aerospace, telecommunications, chemicals, electronics, food processing, consumer goods, lumber, and mining.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p05">The sectors that have grown the most in the past decades are financial services, car manufacturing, and, most important, information technology (IT), which has more than doubled its output in the past decade. It now accounts for nearly 10 percent of the country’s GDP. As impressive as that figure is, it hardly takes into account the many ways in which IT has transformed the US economy. After all, improvements in information technology and telecommunications have increased the productivity of nearly every sector of the economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p06">The United States is so big that its abundant natural resources account for only 4.3 percent of its GDP. Even so, it has the largest agricultural base in the world and is among the world’s leading producers of petroleum and timber products. US farms produce about half the world’s corn—though most of it is grown to feed beef and dairy cattle. The US imports about 30 percent of its oil, despite its own massive reserves. That’s because Americans consume roughly a quarter of the world’s total energy and more than half its oil, making them dependent on other oil-producing nations in some fairly troublesome ways.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p07">The US retail and entertainment industries are very valuable to the economy. The country’s media products, including movies and music, are the country’s most visible exports. When it comes to business, the United States might well be called the “king of the jungle.” Emboldened by a strong free-market economy, legions of US companies have achieved unparalleled success. One by-product of this competitive spirit is an abundance of secure, well-managed business partnerships at home and abroad. And although the majority of US companies aren’t multinational giants, an emphasis on hard work and a sense of fair play pervade the business culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p08">In a culture where entrepreneurialism is practically a national religion, the business landscape is broad and diverse. At one end are enduring multinationals, like Coca-Cola and General Electric, which were founded by visionary entrepreneurs and are now run by boards of directors and appointed managers who answer to shareholders. At the other end of the spectrum are small businesses—millions of them—many owned and operated by a single person.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p09">Today, more companies than ever are “going global,” fueled by an increased demand for varied products and services around the world. Expanding into new markets overseas—often through joint ventures and partnerships—is becoming a requirement for success in business.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p10">Another trend that has gained much media attention is outsourcing—subcontracting work, sometimes to foreign companies. It’s now quite common for companies of all sizes to pay outside firms to do their payroll, provide telecommunications support, and perform a range of operational services. This has led to a growth in small contractors, often operating out of their homes, who offer a variety of services, including advertising, public relations, and graphic design.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_034"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Business Multimedia Series: USA</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2010); <em class="emphasis">bWise: Business Wisdom Worldwide: USA</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

One of the primary purposes of the EU was to create a single market for business and workers accompanied by a single currency, the euro. Internally, the EU has made strides toward abolishing trade barriers, has adopted a common currency, and is striving toward convergence of living standards. Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe’s trade position and its political and economic power. Because of the great differences in per capita income among member states (i.e., from $7,000 to $79,000) and historic national animosities, the EU faces difficulties in devising and enforcing common policies. The EU’s strengths also come from the formidable strengths of some of its economic powerhouse members. Germany is the leading economy in the EU.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Spotlight on Germany</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p01">Germany has the fifth-largest economy in the world, after the United States, China, Japan, and India. With a heavily export-oriented economy, the country is a leading exporter of machinery, vehicles, chemicals, and household equipment and benefits from a highly skilled labor force. It remains the largest and strongest economy in Europe and the second most-populous country after Russia in Europe.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p02">The country has a socially responsible market economy that encourages competition and free initiative for the individual and for business. The <em class="emphasis">Grundgesetz</em> (Basic Law) guarantees private enterprise and private property, but stipulates that these rights must be exercised in the welfare and interest of the public.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p03">Germany’s economic development has been shaped, in large part, by its lack of natural resources, making it highly dependent on other countries. This may explain why the country has repeatedly sought to expand its power, particularly on its eastern flank.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p04">Since the end of World War II, successive governments have sought to retain the basic elements of Germany’s complex economic system (the <em class="emphasis">Soziale Marktwirtschaft</em>). Notably, relationships between employer and employee and between private industry and government have remained stable. Over the years, the country has had few industrial disputes. Furthermore, active participation by all groups in the economic decision making process has ensured a level of cooperation unknown in many other Western countries. Nevertheless, high unemployment and high fiscal deficits are key issues.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p05">Overall, living standards are high, and Germany is a prosperous nation. The majority of Germans live in comfortable housing with modern amenities. The choice of available food is broad and includes cuisine from around the world. Germans enjoy luxury cars, and technology and fashion are big industries. Under federal law, workers are guaranteed minimum income, vacation time, and other benefits. Recently, the government has focused on economic reforms, particularly in the labor market, and tax reduction.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p06">Germany is home to some of the world’s most important businesses and industries. Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW are global forces in the automotive field. Germany remains the fourth-largest auto manufacturer behind China, Japan, and the United States. German BASF, Hoechst, and Bayer are giants in the chemical industry. Siemens, a world leader in electronics, is the country’s largest employer, while Bertelsmann is the largest publishing group in the world. In the banking industry, Deutsche Bank is one of the world’s largest. In addition to these international giants, Germany has many small- and medium-sized, highly specialized firms. These businesses make up a disproportionately large part of Germany’s exports.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s01_p07">Services drive the economy, representing 72.3 percent (in 2009) of the total GDP. Industry accounts for 26.8 percent of the economy, and agriculture represents 0.9 percent. Despite the strong services sector, manufacturing remains one of the most important components of the Germany economy. Key German manufacturing industries are among the world’s largest and most technologically advanced producers of iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals, machinery, vehicles, machine tools, electronics, food and beverages, shipbuilding, and textiles. Manufacturing provides not only significant sources of revenue but also the know-how that Germany exports around the world.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_035"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Business Multimedia Series: Germany</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2010); <em class="emphasis">bWise: Business Wisdom Worldwide: Germany</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p01">Located off the east coast of Asia, the Japanese archipelago consists of four large islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—and about four thousand small islands, which when combined are equal to the size of California.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p02">The American occupation of Japan following World War II laid the foundation for today’s modern economic and political society. The occupation was intended to demilitarize Japan, to fully democratize the government, and to reform Japanese society and the economy. The Americans revised the then-existing constitution along the lines of the British parliamentary model. The Japanese adopted the new constitution in 1946 as an amendment to their original 1889 constitution. On the whole, American reforms rebuilt Japanese industry and were welcomed by the Japanese. The American occupation ended in 1952, when Japan was declared an independent state.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p03">As Japan became an industrial superpower in the 1950s and 1960s, other countries in Asia and the global superpowers began to expect Japan to participate in international aid and defense programs and in regional industrial-development programs. By the late 1960s, Japan had the third-largest economy in the world. However, Japan was no longer free from foreign influences. In one century, the country had gone from being relatively isolated to being dependent on the rest of the world for its resources with an economy reliant on trade.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p04">In the post–World War II period, Japanese politics have not been characterized by sharp divisions between liberal and conservative elements, which in turn have provided enormous support for big business. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), created in 1955 as the result of a merger of two of the country’s biggest political parties, has been in power for most of the postwar period. The LDP, a major proponent of big business, generally supports the conservative viewpoint. The “Iron Triangle,” as it is often called, refers to the tight relationship among Japanese politicians, bureaucrats, and big business leaders.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p05">Until recently, the overwhelming success of the economy overshadowed other policy issues. This is particularly evident with the once powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). For much of Japan’s modern history, MITI has been responsible for establishing, coordinating, and regulating specific industry policies and targets, as well as having control over foreign trade interests. In 2001, its role was assumed by the newly created METI, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p06">Japan’s post–World War II success has been the result of a well-crafted economic policy that is closely administered by the government in alliance with large businesses. Prior to World War II, giant corporate holding companies called <em class="emphasis">zaibatsu</em> worked in cooperation with the government to promote specific industries. At one time, the four largest zaibatsu organizations were Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda. Each of the four had significant holdings in the fields of banking, manufacturing, mining, shipping, and foreign marketing. Policies encouraged lifetime employment, employer paternalism, long-term relationships with suppliers, and minimal competition. Lifetime employment continues today, although it’s coming under pressure in the ongoing recession. This policy is often credited as being one of the stabilizing forces enabling Japanese companies to become global powerhouses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_036">Sanjyot P. Dunung, <em class="emphasis">Doing Business in Asia: The Complete Guide</em>, 2nd ed. (New York: Jossey-Bass, 1998).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p07">The zaibatsus were dismantled after World War II, but some of them reemerged as modern-day <em class="emphasis">keiretsu</em>, and many of their policies continue to have an effect on Japan. Keiretsu refers to the intricate web of financial and nonfinancial relationships between companies that virtually links together in a pattern of formal and informal cross-ownership and mutual obligation. The keiretsu nature of Japanese business has made it difficult for foreign companies to penetrate the commercial sector. In response to recent global economic challenges, the government and private businesses have recognized the need to restructure and deregulate parts of the economy, particularly in the financial sector. However, they have been slow to take action, further aggravating a weakened economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p08">Japan has very few mineral and energy resources and relies heavily on imports to bring in almost all of its oil, iron ore, lead, wool, and cotton. It’s the world’s largest importer of numerous raw materials including coal, copper, zinc, and lumber. Despite a shortage of arable land, Japan has gone to great lengths to minimize its dependency on imported agricultural products and foodstuffs, such as grains and beef. Agriculture represents 1.6 percent of the economy. The country’s chief crops include rice and other grains, vegetables, and fruits. Japanese political and economic protectionist policies have ensured that the Japanese remain fully self-sufficient in rice production, which is their main staple.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p09">As with other developed nations, services lead the economy, representing 76.5 percent of the national GDP.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_037">US Central Intelligence Agency, “East &amp; Southeast Asia: Japan: Economy,” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook</em>, accessed January 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html</a>.</span> Industry accounts for 21.9 percent of the country’s output.

                    <li>The developed economies, also known as advanced economies, are characterized as postindustrial countries—typically with a high per capita income, competitive industries, transparent legal and regulatory environments, and well-developed commercial infrastructure.

However, the United States is the world’s largest single-country economy and accounts for nearly 25 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The strength of the US economy is due in large part to its diversity. Today, the United States has a service-based economy. In 2009, industry accounted for 21.9 percent of the GDP; services (including finance, insurance, and real estate) for 76.9 percent; and agriculture for 1.2 percent.</li>

The residents of these economies tend to have lower discretionary income to spend on nonessential goods (i.e., goods beyond food, housing, clothing, and other necessities). Many people, particularly those in developing countries, often find the classifications limiting or judgmental. The intent here is to focus on understanding the information that a global business professional will need to determine whether a country, including a developing country, offers an interesting local market. Some countries may perceive the classification as a slight; others view it as a benefit. For example, in global trade, being a developing country sometimes provides preferences and extra time to meet any requirements dismantling trade barriers.</p>

In addition, companies assess the political and economic environment in order to evaluate the risks and opportunities for business in managing key government relationships.

In much of Africa and the Middle East, where the economies rely on one or two key industries, the governments remain heavily involved in sourcing and awarding key contracts.

Thanks in large part to the oil-dependent economies, some of these countries are quite wealthy. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s01#fwk-168388-ch09_s01_s02_s01_f02">Figure 4.2 "Per Capita GDP on a Purchasing Power Parity Basis"</a> in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s01#fwk-168388-ch09_s01">Section 4.1 "Classifying World Economies"</a> shows the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) for select countries. Interestingly enough Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain all rank in the top twenty-five. Only Saudi Arabia ranks much lower, due mainly to its larger population; however, it still has a per capita GDP (PPP) twice as high as the global average.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p02">While the income level suggests a strong opportunity for global businesses, the inequality of access to goods and services, along with an inadequate and uncompetitive local economy, present both concerns and opportunities. Many of these countries are making efforts to shift from being an oil-dependent economy to a more service-based economy. Dubai, one of the seven emirates in the UAE, has sought to be the premier financial center for the Middle East. The financial crisis of 2008 has temporarily hampered, but not destroyed, these ambitions.</p>

Dubai’s tourism attracts visitors from its more religiously conservative neighbors such as Saudi Arabia as well as from countries in South Asia, primarily for its extensive shopping options.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s02_s01_s01_p05">Today, the country’s main industries are petroleum and petrochemicals (which account for a sizeable 25 percent of total GDP), fishing, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, commercial ship repair, construction materials, some boat building, handicrafts, and textiles. With the UAE’s intense investment in infrastructure and greening projects, the coastlines have been enhanced with large parks and gardens. Furthermore, the UAE has transformed offshore islands into agricultural projects that produce food.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s02_s01_s01_p06">A key issue for the UAE is the composition of its residents and workforce. The UAE is perhaps one of the few countries in the world where expatriates outnumber the local citizens, or nationals. In fact, of the total population of almost 5 million people, only 20 percent are citizens, and the workforce is composed of individuals from 202 different countries. As a result, the UAE is an incredible melting pot of cultural, linguistic, and religious groups. Migrant workers come mainly from the Indian subcontinent: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka as well as from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and other Arab nations. A much smaller number of skilled managers come from Europe, Australia, and North America. While technically the diverse population results in a higher level of religious diversity than neighboring Arab countries, the UAE is an Islamic country.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s02_s01_s01_p07">The UAE actively encourages foreign companies to open branches in the country, so it is quite common and easy for foreign corporations to do so. Free-trade zones allow for 100 percent foreign ownership and no taxes. Nevertheless, it’s common and in some industries required for many companies outside the free-trade zone to have an Emirati sponsor or partner.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s02_s01_s01_p08">While the UAE is generally open for global business, recently Research in Motion (RIM) found itself at odds with the UAE government, which wanted to block Blackberry access in the country. RIM uses a proprietary encryption technology to protect data and sends it to offshore servers in North America. For some countries, such as the UAE, this data encryption is perceived as a national security threat. Some governments want to be able to access the communications of people they consider high security threats. The UAE government and RIM were able to resolve this issue, and Blackberry service was not suspended.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s02_s01_s01_p09">Human rights concerns have forced the UAE government to address the rights of children, women, minorities, and guest workers with legal consistency, a process that is continuing to evolve. Today, the UAE is focused on reducing its dependence on oil and its reliance on foreign workers by diversifying its economy and creating more opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased private sector employment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_051"><em class="emphasis">bWise: Business Wisdom Worldwide: U.A.E.</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

Although recent elections have been marred by violence and accusations of voter fraud, Nigeria is technically experiencing its longest period of civilian government since its independence. However, Nigeria remains a fractious nation, divided along ethnic and religious lines.</p>

The Nigerian government continues to face the challenge of reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing the early efforts at democracy. “Oil-rich Nigeria, long hobbled by political instability, corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and poor macroeconomic management, has undertaken several reforms over the past decade. Nigeria’s former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides 95 percent of foreign exchange earnings and about 80 percent of budgetary revenues.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_057">US Central Intelligence Agency, “Africa: Nigeria,” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook</em>, accessed January 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html</a>.</span></p>

However, it’s important to remember that all of the emerging-market countries were once considered developing nations. What resulted in the transition? Are today’s developing countries turning into tomorrow’s emerging markets? These are the questions that not only global economists and development experts ask, but—more relevantly—global businesses as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s03_s03_p02">Typically, the factors that result in the classification of many countries as developing economies are the same ones that—once addressed and corrected—enable these countries to become emerging markets.

Developing the local commercial infrastructure and reducing trade barriers attract foreign businesses.

Developing countries need to improve their education systems and create a strategy to begin their transition to the global emerging market.

Traditionally an agriculture-based economy, Mongolia is landlocked by its borders with China and Russia and is the approximately the size of Western Europe, with a relatively small population. However, its tremendous untapped mineral resources, which include coal, copper, molybdenum, fluorspar, tin, tungsten, gold, and oil, are attracting foreign investment. The country is a major exporter to China—its large, relatively rich neighbor.

        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Is it time to retire the phrase “emerging markets”? Many of the people interviewed for this special report think so.

            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p03">The term “emerging markets” dates back to 1981, recalls the man who invented it, Antoine van Agtmael. He was trying to start a “Third-World Equity Fund” to invest in developing-country shares, but his efforts to attract money were constantly rebuffed. “Racking my brain, at last I came up with a term that sounded more positive and invigorating: emerging markets. ‘Third world’ suggested stagnation; ‘emerging markets’ suggested progress, uplift and dynamism.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_064">“Ins and Outs: Acronyms BRIC Out All Over,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, September 18, 2008, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/node/12080703">http://www.economist.com/node/12080703</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p04">The 2008 article clearly articulates the challenge for global businesses, as well as analysts, who are trying to both define and understand the group of countries typically termed the emerging market. In a 2008 <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em> article, Vladimir Kvint, president of the International Academy of Emerging Markets, noted the following:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p05">During the last 20 years, the global business world has gone through drastic, but mostly positive changes. In the 1980s, international business was essentially an exclusive club of the 20 richest countries. This changed as dictatorships and command economies collapsed throughout the world. Countries that once prohibited foreign investment from operating on their soil and were isolated from international cooperation are now part of the global marketplace.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p06">I remember well when, in 1987, the first $80 million of foreign origin was allowed to be invested in the former Soviet Union. So-called “patriots” accused Mikhail Gorbachev of selling their motherland. Twenty years later, in 2007, Russia received about $43 billion of foreign direct investment, and emerging-market countries received about 40 percent of the $1.5 trillion FDI [foreign direct investment] worldwide.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_065">Vladimir Kvint, “Define Emerging Markets Now,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, January 28, 2008, accessed January 5, 3011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/kvint-developing-countries-oped-cx_kv_0129kvint.html">http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/kvint-developing-countries-oped-cx_kv_0129kvint.html</a>.</span></p>

As discussed in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch09_s01#fwk-168388-ch09_s01">Section 4.1 "Classifying World Economies"</a>, there is a plethora of statistics and data available. The application and interpretation of this information varies depending on who is doing the analysis—a private sector business, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations (UN), or any number of global economic, political, and trade organizations. The varying statistics, in turn, produce a changing number of countries that “qualify” as emerging markets. For many businesspeople, the definition of an emerging market has been simply a country that was once a developing country but has achieved rapid economic growth, modernization, and industrialization. However, this approach can be limiting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p08">Knowing that there are wide inconsistencies, how do we define emerging markets consistently from the perspective of global businesses? First, understand that there are some common characteristics in terms of local population size, growth opportunities with changes in the local commercial infrastructure, regulatory and trade policies, efficiency improvements, and an overall investment in the education and well-being of the local population, which in turn is expected to increase local incomes and purchasing capabilities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p09">As a leading economic and strategic thinker in the area of emerging markets, Kvint concludes from his research that there are several major characteristics of emerging markets, which create “a comfortable and attractive environment for global business, foreign investment and international trade. Based on my study, an emerging market country can be defined as a society transitioning from a dictatorship to a free market-oriented economy, with increasing economic freedom, gradual integration within the global marketplace, an expanding middle class, improving standards of living and social stability and tolerance, as well as an increase in cooperation with multilateral institutions.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_066">Vladimir Kvint, “Define Emerging Markets Now,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, January 28, 2008, accessed January 5, 3011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/kvint-developing-countries-oped-cx_kv_0129kvint.html">http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/kvint-developing-countries-oped-cx_kv_0129kvint.html</a>.</span></p>

China is the world’s second-largest economy, at 9.3 per cent of global GDP (the US is worth 23.6 per cent), while Brazil, India and Russia combined provide a further 8 per cent. O’Neill offers a new approach that will involve looking at fresh ways to measure exposure to equity markets beyond market capitalisation—for example, looking at gross domestic product, corporate revenue growth and the volatility of asset returns.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_069">Jennifer Hughes, “‘Bric’ Creator Adds Newcomers to List,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, January 16, 2010, accessed January 5, 3011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f717c8e8-21be-11e0-9e3b-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1MKbbO8ET">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f717c8e8-21be-11e0-9e3b-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1MKbbO8ET</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s01_p19">These opinions and analyses by different economists are highlighted in this chapter to illustrate that the category of emerging markets is complex, evolving, and subject to wide interpretation. So how then do savvy global professionals sort through all of this information? Managers focus on the criteria for emerging markets in an effort to take advantage of newly emerging ones. While there are differing opinions on which countries are emerging, it’s clear that global businesses are focused on the groups of countries offering strong domestic markets. Many of these emerging-market countries are also home to companies that are taking advantage of the improved business conditions there. These companies are becoming world-class global competitors in their industries. Regardless of which definition or classification is used, the largest emerging markets remain lucrative and promising.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_070">The sections that follow are excerpted in part from two resources owned by author Sanjyot P.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p01">Located below Russia on the western seaboard of the Pacific Ocean, China is about as large as the continent of Europe and slightly larger than the United States. It is the third-largest country in the world after Russia and Canada.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p02">For more than fifty years, China has had a centrally planned economy in which the state controlled most of the commercial activity. Under Mao Zedong’s over forty-year leadership, the Chinese government kept a firm grip on the country’s economic activity. That grip has been loosening since the 1980s as a result of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, which introduced some strong capitalist characteristics into China’s centrally planned economy. Since the early 1980s, the Chinese economy has been in transition away from central planning and toward a market-driven economy. In today’s model, market forces work in conjunction with state ownership and intervention. This system is commonly referred to as “a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics.” The government now realizes that it can’t provide all the resources needed to fuel the economy by itself and that the private sector has a major role to play in providing investment—and jobs. Today, China’s economy is caught between two opposing forces—a burgeoning market sector that is outgrowing government control and the inability of that market to function efficiently due to continued influence by the state on production and prices.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p03">In 1979, China instituted economic reforms, established “special economic zones,” and opened its economy to foreign investments and companies. This change in attitude brought remarkable changes to the socialist market economy, resulting in improved living standards and new social attitudes. As local provinces have benefited from foreign investment, particularly in the south, central economic control has weakened. Since 1978, industrial output has increased more than sixfold, in large part due to foreign manufacturers and investors who have established operations in China (usually as joint ventures with corporations owned or influenced by the Chinese government but also with some private-sector companies).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p04">In many areas, China remains a predominantly agricultural society. Major crops include rice, barley, millet, tobacco, sweet potatoes, wheat, soybeans, cotton, tea, raw silk, rapeseed, corn, peanuts, watermelon, and sesame seed. Under the 1979 regulations, peasants were permitted to lease land for private farming and were allowed to sell for profit any surplus produce above the quota demanded by the state in the open market. There are still more collectives than family farms, but this is changing. Besides agriculture, the leading industries include textiles, machinery, cement, chemicals, communications and transportation equipment, building materials, and electronic machinery and equipment.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p05">The results of these reforms have been spectacular—China’s economy has grown an average of 9 percent per year over the last fifteen years and is now the second largest in the world. If it continues at this rate of expansion, some pundits predict China could eventually replace the United States in first place.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p06">One of the most interesting facets of China’s economic transition has been the rise of the middle class. Prior to the 1980s, there was only a small middle class, with most people occupying the lower echelons of the economic ladder. Now it’s estimated that some 300 million Chinese have entered the middle-class cohort, fueling a huge increase in consumer spending.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p07">In the 1990s, the seven-day workweek was progressively lowered to five days. With increased time off and longer national holidays, the average Chinese person now has more leisure time—and more time to spend money on consumer goods.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p08">Take a look at some of China’s major cities—particularly those along the eastern coast—and you’ll see soaring skyscrapers, glitzy boutiques, luxury hotels, and expensive cars. There’s a feeling of economic prosperity and high-powered consumerism. Apartment buildings aimed at the prosperous middle-class market are sprouting up all over China’s major cities.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p09">Travel just a few hundred miles from the cities, though, and you’ll encounter farming scenes reminiscent of the early days of the twentieth century. The economic disparity between the urban rich and the rural poor and all its accompanying problems are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p10">With a burgeoning market sector that’s outgrowing government control, China is now at the crossroads of reform. Yet despite the high growth rates, enormous challenges remain, including marked regional inequality, an entrenched and at times inflexible bureaucracy, high unemployment, a large floating population, and environmental degradation. Most commentators agree that the country has recognized the complex issues facing its economic future and is now ready to address them.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p11">The growth of China’s telecommunications industry is outstripping expectations. The number of mobile-phone subscribers, for example, has grown from 1 million in 1994 to around 700 million in 2009.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_071">Wang Xing, “Battle Begins over 3G Market,” <em class="emphasis">China Daily</em>, October 19, 2009, accessed May 17, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2009-10/19/content_8808873.htm">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2009-10/19/content_8808873.htm</a>.</span> But the industry’s expansion hasn’t automatically led to large profits.

In fact, a 2009 <em class="emphasis">China Daily</em> article claims that China’s telecom market the biggest battlefield in the world.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_072">Wang Xing, “Battle Begins over 3G Market,” <em class="emphasis">China Daily</em>, October 19, 2009, accessed May 17, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2009-10/19/content_8808873.htm">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2009-10/19/content_8808873.htm</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p12">Internet use is also expanding rapidly, although its spread is hindered by the government’s attempts to regulate the sector and control access as evidenced in the case between the government and Google in the spring of 2010, as discussed in the case study in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch01#fwk-168388-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction"</a>. Keeping up with the newest technology in the areas of delivery networks, broadband access, payment procedures, and security has created enormous opportunities. The government has made extensive efforts to invest in infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p13">In 2009, agriculture accounted for an estimated 10.6 percent of China’s gross domestic product (GDP), industry represented 46.8 percent, and services totaled 42.6 percent. Apart from agriculture, China’s leading industries include “mining and ore processing of iron, steel, aluminum, and other metals, coal; machine building; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemicals; fertilizers; consumer products, including footwear, toys, and electronics; food processing; transportation equipment, including automobiles, rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; telecommunications equipment; commercial space launch vehicles; and satellites.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_073">US Central Intelligence Agency, “East &amp; Southeast Asia: China,” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook</em>, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html</a>.</span> The production of consumer goods is now one of the fastest-growing sectors in the economy. Once a source of cheap consumer electronics for the West, China is now producing those items for its own rapidly expanding internal market.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p14">Chinese economic statistics must still be regarded with a degree of skepticism. Often it’s unclear where the numbers have originated or how they have been derived. Still, there’s no doubt that phenomenal growth is taking place, and there are pressures for a more transparent economic reporting system.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p15">In the past, China didn’t see the environment as an issue in its race to industrialize. Now, there is an increasing sense of environmental awareness. “China is changing from the factory of the world to the clean-tech laboratory of the world. It has the unique ability to pit low-cost capital with large-scale experiments to find models that work.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_074">Thomas L. Friedman, “World, Not U.S., Takes Lead with Green Technology,” <em class="emphasis">Post-Bulletin</em>, September 21, 2010, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=12&amp;a=470550">http://www.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=12&amp;a=470550</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p16">Government attention and foreign investment have been focused on further developing the country’s inadequate infrastructure, including roads, railways, seaports, communications systems, and power generation. Industrial capability, in both light and heavy industries, has also improved. China is a vast country rich in natural resources, including coal, oil, gas, various metals, ores, and minerals.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p17">The largest Chinese companies are those that have capitalized on China’s natural strengths and have state backing or are state-run. For example, PetroChina is the country’s largest oil and gas producer and distributor. PetroChina is the listed arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). It is one of the world’s largest oil producers and is the world’s most valuable company by market value as of 2010, exceeding a trillion-dollar market capitalization. China’s largest companies have benefited from this combination of government support through access to capital and markets along with private-sector efficiencies. For more on Chinese companies in Africa, see the case study in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch05#fwk-168388-ch05">Chapter 2 "International Trade and Foreign Direct Investment"</a>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s01_p18">China joined the WTO in December 2001, and it will likely be drawn even more into the global economy as companies continue to vie for access to its 1.3 billion consumers and cheap and productive labor pool. Most companies expect that dealing with China will now become more straightforward, if not easier. Whatever the future brings, the Chinese economy continues to be a powerhouse of growth and opportunity. <span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_075"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Business Multimedia Series: China</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2010); <em class="emphasis">bWise: Business Wisdom Worldwide: China</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Spotlight on India</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p01">India is officially called the Republic of India and is also known as Hindustan or Bharat. As the seventh-largest country in the world, India spans 1.267 million square miles; it’s about one-third the size of the United States. India shares borders in the northwest with Pakistan; in the north with China, Bhutan, and Nepal; and in the east with Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma). The Indian territory also extends to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal as well as to Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p02">Prior to the mid-1980s, the country pursued a policy of socialism with the state planning and controlling many sectors of the economy. Foreign investment had been discouraged except in the area of technology transfers. Since the early 1990s, India has embarked on an economic liberalization scheme that has proven beneficial to the country.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p03">In 1991, India was on the brink of defaulting on its foreign debt. The government responded with a series of successful measures to initiate widespread economic reforms, including reducing export and import barriers, dismantling some of its swollen bureaucracy, making the currency partially convertible, and eliminating the black market for foreign currency and gold. Efforts were also made to privatize or increase the efficiencies of unprofitable state companies. Finance Minister Manmohan Singh (who later became prime minister) was successful in beginning to dismantle the “License Raj,” an intricate system of government economic control through permits and quotas. Various policies initiated by the government provided a larger role for the private sector and encouraged foreign investment. As a result, investment increased, though at much lower levels than in other Asian countries.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p04">Since the 1990s, central government intervention, licensing, and regulation have decreased, as have bureaucratic inefficiencies. India boasts an established free-market system; a sophisticated industrial and manufacturing base; and a huge pool of skilled, low-to-moderate-cost workers, including professional managers. Economic gains, particularly as a result of further integration into the global economy, have provided improved the standard of living for all communities. The country’s 2.1 percent annual population growth ensures that its population will surpass China’s within the next decade and remains a significant problem for the government, as limited resources threaten the distribution of economic reform benefits.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p05">The country is rich in natural resources, such as rubber, timber, chromium, coal, iron, manganese, copper ore, petroleum, bauxite, titanium, mica salt, limestone, and gypsum. The country is one of the world’s leading producers of iron ore, and coal accounts for nearly 40 percent of all mined minerals. India also has reserves of natural gas and oil, but it remains a net importer of crude oil because its domestic generation is insufficient to meet demand. In addition, India has deposits of precious stones, including diamonds, emeralds, gold, and silver. Cut diamonds are one of India’s biggest exports.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p06">Agriculture remains an important economic sector, contributing roughly 17 percent of the country’s GDP and employing almost 52 percent of the workforce. Major crops include rice, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, cotton, jute, oilseeds, tea, coffee, tobacco, onions, and potatoes. Other important agricultural interests include dairy products, sheep, goats, poultry, and fish.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p07">Until the mid-1960s, India imported much of its food. The Green Revolution focused on improving farming techniques, increasing mechanization, and irrigating as well as introducing high-yielding seeds. All of these have increased agricultural production and made the country self-sufficient in food production. The government also provides incentives to farmers to expand production. Most of India’s farms tend to be small and provide subsistence for the families that operate them. They aren’t geared for commercial purposes. Northern fertile areas, such as those in the state of Punjab, account for much of the export production.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p08">While India has more cattle than any other country, it isn’t farmed for food consumption as Hindus are not supposed to eat beef. The animals are used for a variety of other purposes, including plowing land, producing milk for dairy products, and supplying leather.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p09">The growth of Indian industry, which accounts for about 28.2 percent of its GDP and 14 percent of employment, has resulted in widespread improvements and diversity in the country’s manufacturing base. The major manufacturing industries include cotton and jute textiles; iron, steel, and other basic metals; petrochemicals; electrical machinery and appliances; transport equipment; chemicals; cement; fertilizers; software; medicines and pharmaceuticals; and food products. The power, electronics, food processing, software, transportation equipment, and telecommunications industries are developing rapidly. The financial sector, including banking and insurance, is well developed, although efforts to modernize it are underway.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p10">State-run entities continue to control some areas of telecommunications, banking, insurance, public utilities, and defense, as well as the production of minerals, steel, other metals, coal, natural gas, and petroleum. There have been some steps taken to shift more control to the private sector, although on a gradual and closely monitored scale.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p11">Services account for 54.9 percent of the GDP, but employ only 34 percent of the workforce. The most dramatic change in the economy has come from the computer-programming industry, as companies around the world have turned to India for outsourcing. With its skilled, relatively cheap, and English-speaking professional workforce, India has received a much-needed boost in the form of investment and foreign earnings. This is expected to have continued significant impact on the economy, business environment, and the social values and expectations of the Indian population.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s01_s02_p12">India’s technology firms have gained global recognition. One of the best known is Infosys. Founded in 1981 by seven Indian entrepreneurs, Infosys today is a NASDAQ-listed global consulting and information technology services company—with $5.4 billion in revenues. Throughout twenty-nine years of growth, Infosys, in addition to other well-managed Indian companies, has been well positioned to take advantage of the Indian government’s efforts at economic liberalization that began in the early 1990s. Under this program, the government has systematically reduced trade barriers and embraced globalization. These changes have led to India’s emergence as the global destination for software services talent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_076"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Business Multimedia Series: India</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2010); <em class="emphasis">bWise: Business Wisdom Worldwide: India</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p01">Russia is the largest country in the world, stretching across two continents and eleven time zones. Eleven seas and two oceans wash the banks of this 6.6 million square mile territory. The south and southeast of the country are covered with mountains, and the central part is a plain, furrowed with rivers. Around 7,000 lakes spread over the western part of Russia. The border between Europe and Asia runs down the west side of the Ural Mountains, about 807 miles east of Moscow.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p02">Anyone looking to do business in Russia today needs to comprehend the array of changes that have impacted the nation over the past three decades. Rising to power in the 1980s, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev was the first leader to end repressive political controls and to suffer nationalist movements in the constituent republics. Gorbachev set the forces in action that would overturn the Communist regime and seal his own expulsion. He relaxed government control on the media and the Russian culture, implementing a policy of <em class="emphasis">glasnost</em>, or openness and candor. Gorbachev also sought <em class="emphasis">perestroika</em> (i.e., restructuring) of the economy and political system that preserved some of the more positive elements of socialism. Gorbachev gained international fame as the head of the Soviet bloc who helped put an end to the Cold War. To reach a common understanding, Gorbachev met repeatedly with US Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, helping broker arms-reduction agreements.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p03">During Gorbachev’s term, Communist regimes began to fall all over Eastern Europe. In an abrupt departure from previous Soviet policy, Gorbachev refused to intervene. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and Gorbachev did nothing to stop it. Sensing weakness, republic parliaments all over the Soviet bloc asserted their sovereignty; a few even went so far as to assert complete independence. In 1991, when Gorbachev attempted to negotiate with the republics, alarmed Soviet leaders attempted a coup. The coup failed, but Gorbachev had lost his political cache to rival Boris Yeltsin, who succeeded Gorbachev as the hero of the era. This changed political, economic, and military dynamics around the world.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p04">While the changes Gorbachev implemented did little to develop the Soviet Union’s struggling economy, he did overhaul Soviet elections by reintroducing multiparty elections in 1989. This essentially invited political dissidents and reform-minded leaders into the parliament. These individuals soon began to challenge Gorbachev’s leadership, pushing him to implement more changes. In 1991, Gorbachev conceded to their demands and installed their leader, Boris Yeltsin, as the president of Russia.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p05">The economic and political challenges the newly independent country faced were considerable. The inefficiency of the Soviet government had left its stamp on every area of the economy. Russia’s industries had to update their technology, retrain their workers, and cut back their workforces. Russians were largely unfamiliar with Western ways of doing business and found it difficult to make the changes mandated by capitalism. Unemployment soared, and the plight of most Russians grew increasingly desperate.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p06">In this climate of desperation, Yeltsin’s government instituted a so-called shock therapy program intended to galvanize the economy by reducing barriers to free trade. These policies, while well intentioned, produced sweeping inflation that almost completely devalued Russian currency. Western newspapers were plastered with images of Russians waiting in long lines, carrying bags of devalued bills. In an attempt to address the crisis, the government introduced a privatization program, which resulted in rampant cronyism and theft of state property.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p07">While the government encouraged the emergence of small businesses and the already-flourishing black-market trade was finally legitimatized, small businesses faced many obstacles inadvertently caused by the government’s inefficiency. The tax system was so disorganized that the government couldn’t obtain the funds necessary to sustain adequate police or military forces. Health care and other basic welfare systems collapsed, and organized crime forced small businesses to make regular payoffs.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p08">As quality of life took a precipitous drop for the majority of the Russian population, the gap between the rich and poor broadened dramatically. But crime lords weren’t the only ones profiting from the gap, the privatization of government assets enabled a few well-placed individuals to turn those assets into their private property. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nouveau riche</a><span class="glossdef">People who have acquired substantial wealth in one generation (i.e., new money).</span></span>, as this class of Russians was called, tended to be ostentatious, and the construction of elaborate mansions at a time when ordinary Russians were suffering, outraged the citizens’ sense of justice.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p10">Russian industry is primarily split between globally competitive commodity producers—in 2009 Russia was the world’s largest exporter of natural gas, the second largest exporter of oil, and the third largest exporter of steel and primary aluminum—and other less competitive heavy industries that remain dependent on the Russian domestic market. This reliance on commodity exports makes Russia vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the highly volatile swings in global commodity prices. The government since 2007 has embarked on an ambitious program to reduce this dependency and build up the country’s high-technology sectors but with few results so far. A revival of Russian agriculture in recent years has led to Russia shifting from being a net grain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">importer</a><span class="glossdef">A person or organization that sells products and services that are sourced from other countries.</span></span> to a net grain exporter. Russia has a highly industrialized and agrarian economy. Almost ten million people are engaged in the agriculture industry. Along with its vast spaces, Russia has always been known for its amazing resources. The country produces 30 percent of the world’s nonferrous, rare, and noble metals; 17 percent of the world’s crude oil; 30 percent of natural gas; and it holds 40 percent of the world’s known natural gas deposits. Today, agriculture accounts for 4.7 percent of the economy, industry represents 34.8 percent, and services total 60.5 percent (based on a 2009 estimate).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_082">US Central Intelligence Agency, “Central Asia: Russia,” <em class="emphasis">World Factbook</em>, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html</a>.</span></p>

                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p11">Think global business is all about leading-edge, high-tech gadgets, consumer products, or industrial manufacturing items? Think again. Since the early days of ancient trade, commodities, such as wheat, corn, spices, rice, and cotton, have been the primary objects of trade. Even today, wheat and corn, the most basic of foodstuffs across all cultures, can still make governments and economies—developed, developing, and emerging—quiver as a result of natural and unnatural disruptions to their marketplaces. Recently, in the summer of 2010, Russia experienced a crippling drought that led to a four-month ban on all grain exports. “Russia has become an increasingly important force in the global supply of grains and the move reignited fears that nervous governments would begin hoarding their own supplies, potentially causing a shortage….Countries such as Egypt, the world’s number one importer of wheat, which had bought Russian wheat, now must consider other options.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_083">Liam Pleven, Gregory Zuckerman, and Scott Kilman, “Russian Export Ban Raises Global Food Fears,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, August 6, 2010, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703748904575410740617512592.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703748904575410740617512592.html</a>.</span> Russia provided almost 15 percent of the world’s wheat supply for global exports from the 2009–10 crop. As a result of the ban, many global packaged-foods companies, including Swiss giants, Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund and Coop Schweiz, and British-based Premier Foods, considered possible price increases as a result of the wheat ban.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_084">Liam Pleven, Gregory Zuckerman, and Scott Kilman, “Russian Export Ban Raises Global Food Fears,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, August 6, 2010, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703748904575410740617512592.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703748904575410740617512592.html</a>.</span></p>

Business analysts and investors are eager for the government to privatize more of the largest firms. “The Economic Development Ministry said in July [of 2010] that the privatization list for 2011–2013 included oil pipeline monopoly Transneft, Russia’s largest shipping company Sovcomflot, oil major Rosneft, the country’s largest banks Sberbank and VTB, the Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System, the Russian Agricultural Bank, hydropower holding company RusHydro and other assets.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_085">“Russia Unlikely to Privatize Largest Companies in 2010,” RIA Novosti, August 30, 2010, accessed January 6, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.rian.ru/business/20100830/160394304.html">http://en.rian.ru/business/20100830/160394304.html</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p01">South Africa makes up the southern portion of the continent of Africa, from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Indian Ocean in the east. With a total land area of 750,000 miles, including the Prince Edward Islands, the country is the twenty-seventh largest in the world, or approximately the same size as France, Spain, and Portugal combined.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p02">Initially a refueling station for Dutch sailors traveling to the East, South Africa gradually developed an agricultural sector, based on fruit, wine, and livestock production, along the coast of the Cape of Good Hope. All of this changed dramatically with the discovery of minerals in the late nineteenth century. Subsequently, the country emerged as the leading manufacturing and industrial economy on the African continent.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p03">Surging prices for gold and the high demand for base metals and other mineral products propelled the country’s economy after World War II. South Africa was fortunate to have this strong economic base when international sanctions were applied in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p04">Nonetheless, import substitution and sanction busting were necessary for economic survival, and the country as a whole became increasingly isolated. A handful of massive corporations controlled most of the country’s wealth and provided the majority of goods and services. The national government controlled those sectors of the economy seen as critical to the national interest of the apartheid state, including transportation, telecommunications, and the media.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p05">South Africa practiced legal racial segregation, under the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">apartheid system</a><span class="glossdef">An official policy of racial segregation that was practiced in South Africa with social, economic, and political discrimination against anyone who was not white.</span></span>. In the 1970s, worldwide disapproval of apartheid led to economic sanctions against South Africa. An international oil embargo was imposed in 1974, and the country was suspended from participating in the United Nations. “Disinvestment (or divestment) from South Africa was first advocated in the 1960s, in protest of South Africa’s system of Apartheid, but was not implemented on a significant scale until the mid-1980s. The disinvestment campaign…is credited as pressuring the South African Government to embark on negotiations ultimately leading to the dismantling of the apartheid system.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_087"><em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, s.v. “Disinvestment from South Africa,” last modified February 13, 2011, accessed February 16, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p06">During the 1980s, there was global political and economic isolation. Many global investment firms pulled out of South Africa as a result of the public outcry and investor pressures against apartheid. While global firms, such as PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, IBM, ExxonMobil, and others, didn’t leave South Africa, they endured public boycotts and protests in their home countries. The moral arguments against apartheid eventually won. After F. W. de Klerk was elected president in 1989, change was immediate. Political prisoners were released, and a national debate was initiated on the future of the country. The ban was lifted on the African National Congress (ANC), and in February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after twenty-seven years behind bars. He was elected president in 1994, and to further unite the country, de Klerk agreed to serve as deputy president in his administration.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p07">Following the 1994 election, South Africa’s period as an international outcast came to a swift end. The country was readmitted into the United Nations, and sanctions were lifted. For the first time South Africans could travel freely, had a free press, and participated in truly democratic institutions. Global businesses could once again do business with South Africa without fear of investor or public backlash.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p08">South Africa has emerged as a free-market economy with an active private sector. The country strives to develop a prosperous and balanced regional economy that can compete in global markets. As an emerging-market country, South Africa relies heavily on industrial imports and capital. Specialty minerals and metals, machinery, transport equipment, and chemicals are important import sectors.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p09">Minerals and energy are central to South Africa’s economic activity, and manufacturing, the country’s largest industry, is still based to a large extent on mining. South Africa receives more foreign currency for its gold than for any other single item, although it exports other minerals including platinum, diamonds, coal, chrome, manganese, and iron ore. It is the world’s largest producer of platinum, gold, and chromium. Agricultural products, such as fruit, wool, hides, corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, beef, poultry, mutton, dairy products, and grains, account for 3 percent of its GDP.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p10">Today, industry accounts for 31 percent of the country’s GDP, focusing on mining and automobile assembly, metalworking, machinery, textiles, iron and steel, chemicals, fertilizer, foodstuffs, and commercial ship repair.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p11">During the years of apartheid, the economy of South Africa stagnated and appeared directionless. That changed after the election of the Government of National Unity in 1994. The postapartheid government has clear priorities, including economic growth, job creation, and inequality reduction.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p12">Under apartheid, large conglomerates achieved near-cartel status and stifled competition. In many instances, this occurred with tacit government approval, and many promising small companies were bought or forced out of the market by financial muscle. The overall effect was a blunting of innovation and growth throughout the country. Since the end of apartheid, the government has made significant strides in promoting small-business development, in part by offering large corporations incentives to donate funds to small companies.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p13">With the growth of their international market, South African businesses are expanding their focus outward. Companies such as Anglo American and South African Breweries (SAB) are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and Sappi (formerly South African Pulp and Paper Industries), a giant paper concern, has invested in the US market.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p14">As part of its effort to improve South Africa’s business climate, the government has made a strong commitment to privatization. To date, it has sold parts of South African Airways and Telkom (the former telecommunications monopoly), as well as other companies. The government is also offering incentives to overseas companies to partner with disadvantaged community-owned South African enterprises and requires businesses with government contracts to make contributions to social programs.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p15">Since the end of apartheid, corporate life in South Africa has changed dramatically, and the business scene is now evolving at a fast pace. The government is committed to liberalizing the country’s economy in fundamental ways, and corporate culture is changing in response. Programs to encourage economic growth and globalization have attracted new companies from abroad and introduced new approaches to doing business. Companies have also experienced a boost in creative energy. Today, the hallmarks of the South African business culture are change and transformation.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p16">Day to day, doing business in South Africa is relatively easy and becoming easier as regulations are modified to reflect international norms. At the same time, new policies, particularly in matters of employment and labor, are making business life more complex.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p17">While South African society is officially color free, in practical terms there are many areas of business that are still segregated. Overseas companies looking to break into public-sector contract work would be wise to establish joint ventures with companies owned by blacks.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p18">South Africa has one of the highest union-membership rates in the world—a total of 3.2 million workers, or 25 percent of the employed workforce. Although the labor movement has a reputation for militancy, strikes are virtually unheard of since the job market has become so tight, and labor relations have generally improved.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p19">Because of the country’s strong union culture, managers tend to be highly sensitive to union concerns in the workplace, and union issues are never far from the surface in decision making. In fact, unions used rolling mass action to disrupt the apartheid economy, and this weapon is still available.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s03_s01_p20">Services now total 65 percent of the economy. South Africa has a well-developed financial services sector, and the South African Futures Exchange ranks among the top-ten international (i.e., non-US) stock exchanges. Trade with countries on the African continent has been increasing rapidly.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s04_s01_p02">Brazil remains Latin America’s largest market, the world’s fifth-most-populous country, and the world’s tenth-largest economy in GDP terms. Government policies for disinflation and income support programs for the poorest families have contributed to a significant reduction in poverty rates and income inequality in recent years. However, poverty remains a stubborn challenge for Brazil.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s04_s01_p03">Brazil’s economic history has progressed in cycles, each focused on a single export item. Soon after the arrival of the first Europeans, wood was the hot commodity. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the scramble was for sugar. Eighteenth-century traders lusted for gems, gold, and silver; and finally, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, coffee was king. Rubber had its day as well. Also of economic importance during these cycles were cattle and agriculture, though they mainly served the domestic market.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s04_s01_p04">Brazil is best known as a leading world producer of coffee and sugar. These commodities, no doubt, enable the country to trade on the world’s stage and remain critical to the Brazilian economy to this day. Brazil is also one of the largest producers and exporters of soybeans, orange juice, cocoa, and tropical fruits. A little known fact, however, is that today, nonagricultural products—namely, auto parts, aircraft, and machinery—bring in more money. Ironically, it’s the oft-maligned industrial programs of the 1960s and 1970s that deserve much of the credit for these successes.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s04_s01_p05">Industry came to Brazil in the mid-1800s. The depression of 1929 threw a wrench in development, but the setback was only temporary; during subsequent decades, expansion was steady. Growth was especially healthy between the 1960s and the oil crisis of 1979. It wasn’t until the 1980s, when interest rates busted the charts, that the economy began its descent. The flow of foreign and domestic capital slowed to a trickle, devaluations played havoc with the national currency, and foreign companies initiated debilitating cutbacks or left the country altogether. Severely handicapped in its ability to invest, Brazil plunged into a period of runaway inflation and negative growth rates. To this day, the 1980s are referred to as “the lost decade.”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s04_s01_p06">In the 1990s, the government honed in on three economic goals: (1) trade reform, (2) stabilizing the economy, and (3) building the country’s relationship with the global financial community. In 1994, Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso (often called FHC), launched the Real Plan, which inspired the name for Brazil’s currency (i.e., the real). The plan, with its emphasis on the need for a strong currency, high interest rates, strict limits on government spending, and an opening up of the economy, touched off a boom in Brazil. Foreign capital began pouring in. Brazil’s economic wizards outwitted the forces that wracked Mexico in the mid-1990s as well as Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998. Their main premise was a strong (i.e., increasingly overvalued) real and spiraling interest rates. However, this premise lost validity in January 1999, when the Central Bank stopped defending the real and let the currency float freely.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s04_s02_s04_s01_p07">Economically, the remainder of the 1990s was a qualified success. In 2001 and 2002, Brazil managed to avoid the fate of its neighbor, Argentina. Nevertheless, the country’s finances remained a disaster. Improved prudent economic policy led to early repayment of IMF loans in 2005 and stabilized the economy. Although Brazil has seen significant rates of economic growth in recent years, this growth hasn’t benefited all sectors or all groups to the same extent. Simultaneously, the economy is undergoing major structural changes as large-scale privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises continues.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_091"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Business Multimedia Series: Brazil</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2010); <em class="emphasis">bWise: Business Wisdom Worldwide: Brazil</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

Embraer builds innovative small jets and has become the world’s biggest producer of smaller jet aircraft. The Brazilian food processors, Sadia and Perdigao, exemplify the international entrepreneurship of modern Brazil. Each is a $2 billion enterprise and exports about half of its annual production. Brazil’s abundant resources for producing pork, poultry, and grains and its ideal growing conditions for animal feed provide these companies with many advantages. Both Sadia and Perdigao also have world-class global distribution and supply-chain management systems for product categories in frozen foods, cereals, and ready-to-eat meals.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">4.5</span> Tips in Your Entrepreneurial Walkabout Toolkit</h2>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Researching the Local Market</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p01">When you begin to consider expanding globally, research the local market thoroughly and learn about the country and its culture. Understand the unique business and regulatory relationships that impact your industry. Early in your research and planning process, take a look to see where your competitors are already selling. You can’t enter multiple markets at the same time. You need to prioritize. By studying others’ successes and failures, you’ll be well positioned to determine which markets make the most sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p02">You may, for example, decide that Asia is a good place to do business. Within Asia, you should pick two or three countries and plan to enter a new market only once every two to three years. Regional strategies have the added value of marketing synergies. But as with domestic channels, don’t try to take on more than one new market or distribution at a time. Some younger companies tend to choose countries closer to their headquarters and time zones. Conducting business can be harder if you’re in opposite time zones, unless everything is done via e-mail. Some companies highlight several countries and then choose their first market based on available sales or distribution options. For example, they may have a salesperson eager to start working in a specific market. Often, local partners and salespeople will approach you even before you have formally decided to enter a new global market. It can seem easy to simply let the person start selling, but first make sure you have a plan in place. It will help set goals, manage everyone’s expectations, and determine what a success or failure will look like in terms of revenues, profitability, and time frame.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p03">Large global companies often have a bevy of resources in the form of budgets and consultants to provide information on local markets. Small and midsize companies typically have smaller or no consulting budgets and need to research local markets creatively with existing resources.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p04">A number of resources are available to companies considering new global markets—some more useful than others, depending on the country and on whether the new market is for sourcing or for selling into. The Internet is often the best place to start any research, and e-mail is the best way to contact some of the offices noted below. Many of these organizations operate online exchanges where companies can find partners, customers, and suppliers. The following are key steps to follow when researching a new market:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Develop a relationship with your home country’s embassy and commercial service office in the target country. Many governments realize that large companies have multiple options and that the companies most likely to need their services and insight are smaller or midsize. Some offices charge modest fees for researching lists of potential partners or distributors. Whether you need this list or not, the added insight from an experienced country expert can be quite useful. These commercial service officers will be able to tell you about the track records of other companies within a specific industry or with specific distributors. Even learning about the lack of other companies entering the market may be helpful, as you may identify the reasons for their lack of success or interest. The US Department of State publishes useful information online at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/e/eeb/cba/index.htm">http://www.state.gov/e/eeb/cba/index.htm</a>. The site also provides more general country information.</li>
            <li>Contact the target country’s commercial office within its embassy or consulate in your home country. If the country doesn’t have a trade office, contact the respective diplomatic offices. Even tourist offices can provide you with general information. Most country offices are eager to promote their local economies, even on a small scale. If you’re considering sourcing from the country, they’re usually even more eager to provide you with resources and lists of potential companies as partners or manufacturers.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Contact the chamber of commerce for that country in your home country. These are different from the commercial office noted in the first point, as they tend to be funded by private-sector companies. Many smaller or still-emerging countries may not have a chamber of commerce office yet. You may also want to contact your home nation’s chamber of commerce in the foreign country of interest. For example, in the United States, there are two types of chambers: American Chambers of Commerce (located in numerous countries) and binational chambers of commerce offices (located in the United States).</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p05">The primary difference between the two types of chambers is their location. Both organizations seek to facilitate business interactions between the United States and the respective country, often collaborating on specific projects as well as lobbying governments for protection of US business interests. The American Chambers of Commerce Abroad (AmChams) are affiliated with the US Chamber of Commerce and tend to focus on American business interests in the target country.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_095">“American Chambers of Commerce Abroad,” US Chamber of Commerce, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.uschamber.com/international/directory">http://www.uschamber.com/international/directory</a>.</span> A list of overseas AmChams can be obtained by contacting the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington, DC<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_096">“International,” US Chamber of Commerce, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.uschamber.com/international">http://www.uschamber.com/international</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p06">The binational chambers of commerce located in the United States promote both US business interests and other countries’ interests in the United States. It’s important to note that these are not the International Chamber of Commerce or its World Chambers Federation division, whose mission is to create a business and legal environment that encourages global trade. Instead the binational chambers of commerce are focused on bilateral issues. For example, the American Indonesian Chamber of Commerce is located in New York.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p07">These binational chambers tend to be run by executive directors who really know the countries well, have excellent networks of US and domestic companies, and can supply needed information or facilitate business introductions. Offices run by people who have been in-country for a lengthy period of time will more likely be knowledgeable and full of useful information. Both AmChams and binational organizations tend to be dominated by large, well-established companies, but they can be very useful in research and information gathering as well as in obtaining introductions to possible partners. Again, the strength of any of these organizations usually rests with the executive director.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p08">Chambers of commerce are also great places to get in touch with others who are experienced in dealing with a country, either as advisors, consultants, or hires. Utilize the expatriate community located within that country, as well as those who have recently returned to your home country, as sources for valuable information about the country and its business climate and practices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Contact the US Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration office in your state and in Washington, DC, or the respective trade office in your home country, and speak with the desk officer for the country of interest. In the United States, general trade information can be obtained at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ita.doc.gov">http://www.ita.doc.gov</a> or <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatrade.com">http://www.usatrade.com</a>. Government trade offices also provide an export program guide that lists resources available at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ita.doc.gov/exportamerica/AskTheTIC/03_02qa.html">http://www.ita.doc.gov/exportamerica/AskTheTIC/03_02qa.html</a>.</li>
            <li>Find out if your home state or city has a “sister” state/city relationship with specific countries and if promotional opportunities are available.</li>
            <li>If possible, conduct a fact-finding trip to your country of interest. Participate in any delegation or trade mission that the US Department of Commerce, your local chamber of commerce office, or other trade organizations sponsor. Always review the agenda and list of meetings carefully. Make sure not only that they fit the needs of your industry and company but also that the people are decision makers and not just political figureheads.</li>
            <li>Attend trade shows in the country or region of interest. Trade shows have become particularly popular for smaller companies, as many organizers offer smaller booth options with lower fees or allow companies to share both spaces and costs. In many cases, country trade offices also facilitate trade trips to a target country or trade show. The delegation often shares exhibition space to minimize cost. Most of these shows are organized by the specific industries; schedules are available online and through the country’s trade or diplomatic offices.</li>
            <li>Be creative. Find common connections with companies in the country. Also seek connections with individuals who have experience doing business in the country or with the specific company with which you are dealing (e.g., a company or individual that you interact with that also does business in your target country). Talk to natives from the country that live in your home nation. Even if there is no direct business application for the information you glean from such sources, you will be able to gather a great deal of cultural and social information that you may be able to put to good use.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Approach vendors and clients. If you are hoping to win local business through government contracts, you may want to approach larger vendors that are more likely to obtain the overseas contracts. Many of them have blanket government contracts and look to subcontract for specific goods and services. Further, they often have a requirement to utilize small businesses, particularly those that are owned by women or minorities.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p09">The entire government-contracting industry is very time-consuming and will require resources up front to cultivate the necessary relationships and process the required paperwork. Unless you’re sure that your product or service is required or have established buying relationships, it’s not the best first sales prospect given the lengthy sales cycle. Many service companies start to work in new markets through project contracts for specific tasks and time periods. It can take longer to build a sustainable business in a country, but the projects allow you to learn about the country and its business practices as well as identify local partners. Most young companies initially choose to partner with a local service firm rather than try to establish their own office.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch09_s05_s01_p10">Recognize that some embassies, offices, and individual officers are better able to assist you in your efforts. For example, junior-ranking career people who have spent more time in the local country are often more insightful and knowledgeable than senior and politically appointed officers with less in-country experience. Over time and through research and references, you will learn which officers and professionals have the most experience and knowledge. As a safety measure, double-check all information with at least two independent sources. Also, be aware that the embassies in your home country may differ in their degree of responsiveness to foreign interest. Don’t automatically assume that the embassies or trade representatives of the larger or more economically advanced countries are more efficient or helpful.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn09_097">Excerpted from Sanjyot P.
