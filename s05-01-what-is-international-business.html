        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch01_s01_s01_p01">As the opening case study on Google suggests, international business relates to any situation where the production or distribution of goods or services crosses country borders. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Globalization</a><span class="glossdef">The shift toward a more interdependent and integrated global economy.</span></span>—the shift toward a more interdependent and integrated global economy—creates greater opportunities for international business. Such globalization can take place in terms of markets, where trade barriers are falling and buyer preferences are changing. It can also be seen in terms of production, where a company can source goods and services easily from other countries. Some managers consider the definition of international business to relate purely to “business,” as suggested in the Google case. However, a broader definition of international business may serve you better both personally and professionally in a world that has moved beyond simple industrial production. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">International business</a><span class="glossdef">All cross-border exchanges of goods, services, or resources between two or more nations. These exchanges can go beyond the exchange of money for physical goods to include international transfers of other resources, such as people, intellectual property, and contractual assets or liabilities.</span></span> encompasses a full range of cross-border exchanges of goods, services, or resources between two or more nations. These exchanges can go beyond the exchange of money for physical goods to include international transfers of other resources, such as people, intellectual property (e.g., patents, copyrights, brand trademarks, and data), and contractual assets or liabilities (e.g., the right to use some foreign asset, provide some future service to foreign customers, or execute a complex financial instrument). The entities involved in international business range from large multinational firms with thousands of employees doing business in many countries around the world to a small one-person company acting as an importer or exporter. This broader definition of international business also encompasses for-profit border-crossing transactions as well as transactions motivated by nonfinancial gains (e.g., triple bottom line, corporate social responsibility, and political favor) that affect a business’s future.</p>

The SWOT tool helps you take stock of an organization’s internal characteristics—its strengths and weaknesses—to formulate an action plan that builds on what it does well while overcoming or working around weaknesses. Similarly, the external part of SWOT—the opportunities and threats—helps you assess those environmental conditions that favor or threaten the organization’s strategy. Because strategic management is concerned with organizational performance—be that social, environmental, or economic—your understanding of a company’s SWOT will help you better assess how international business factors should be accounted for in the firm’s strategy.</p>

Entrepreneurship, like strategic management, will help you to think about the opportunities available when you connect new ideas with new markets. For instance, given Google’s current global presence, it’s difficult to imagine that the company started out slightly more than a decade ago as the entrepreneurial venture of two college students. Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University. It was first incorporated as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. Increasingly, as the Google case study demonstrates, international businesses have an opportunity to create positive social, environmental, and economic values across borders. An entrepreneurial perspective will serve you well in this regard.</p>

Even better, the soccer ball can replace kerosene lamps. Burning kerosene is not only bad for the environment because of carbon dioxide emissions but it’s also a health hazard: according to the World Bank, breathing kerosene fumes indoors has the same effects as smoking two packs of cigarettes per day.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn01_015">Ariel Schwartz, “The SOccket: A Soccer Ball to Replace Kerosene Lamps,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, January 26, 2010, accessed November 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/soccket-soccer-ball-replace-kerosene-lamps">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/soccket-soccer-ball-replace-kerosene-lamps</a>.</span></p>

All four students (Jessica Lin, Jessica Matthews, Julia Silverman, and Hemali Thakkar) had experience with developing countries, so they knew that kids love playing soccer (it’s the world’s most popular sport). They also knew that most of these kids lived in homes that had no reliable energy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn01_016">Clark Boyd, “SOccket: Soccer Ball by Day, Light by Night,” <em class="emphasis">Discovery News</em>, February 18, 2010, accessed November 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/soccket-soccer-ball-by-day-light-by-night.html">http://news.discovery.com/tech/soccket-soccer-ball-by-day-light-by-night.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch01_s01_s02_p07">At this point it’s also important to introduce you to the concepts of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intrapreneurship</a><span class="glossdef">A form of entrepreneurship that takes place in a business that is already in existence.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intrapreneur</a><span class="glossdef">A person within an established business who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk taking and innovation.</span></span>. Intrapreneurship is a form of entrepreneurship that takes place inside a business that is already in existence. An intrapreneur, in turn, is a person within the established business who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk taking and innovation. An entrepreneur is starting a business, while an intrapreneur is developing a new product or service in an already existing business. Thus, the ideas of entrepreneurship can be applied not only in new ventures but also in the context of existing organizations—even government.</p>
