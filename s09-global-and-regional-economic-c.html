    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_p01">Following World War II, there’s been a shift in thinking toward trade. Nations have moved away from thinking that trade was a zero-sum game of either win or lose to a philosophy of increasing trade for the benefit of all. Additionally, coming out of a second global war that destroyed nations, resources, and the balance of peace, nations were eager for a new model that would not only focus on promoting and expanding free trade but would also contribute to world peace by creating international economic, political, and social cooperative agreements and institutions to support them. While this may sound impossible to achieve, international agreements and institutions have succeeded—at a minimum—in creating an ongoing forum for dialogue on trade and related issues. Reducing the barriers to trade and expanding global and regional cooperation have functioned as flatteners in an increasingly flat world. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch06_s01#fwk-168388-ch06_s01">Section 5.1 "International Economic Cooperation among Nations"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch06_s02#fwk-168388-ch06_s02">Section 5.2 "Regional Economic Integration"</a> review the specific economic agreements governing global and regional trade—the successes and the challenges. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch06_s03#fwk-168388-ch06_s03">Section 5.3 "The United Nations and the Impact on Trade"</a> also looks at the United Nations as a key global institution and its impact on free and fair global trade.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p01">In <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch05#fwk-168388-ch05">Chapter 2 "International Trade and Foreign Direct Investment"</a>, you saw how political and legal factors impacted trade. In this chapter, you’ll learn more about how governments seek to cooperate with one another by entering into trade agreements in order to facilitate business.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p02">The European Union (EU) is one such example. The EU started after World War II, initially as a series of trade agreements between six European countries geared to avoid yet another war on European soil. Six decades later, with free-flowing trade and people, a single currency, and regional peace, it’s easy to see why so many believed that an economic union made the best sense. However, the EU is facing its first major economic crisis, and many pundits are questioning how the EU will handle this major stress test. Will it survive? To better answer this question, let’s look at what really happened during the financial crisis in Europe and in particular in Greece.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p03">At its most basic level, countries want to encourage the growth of their domestic businesses by expanding trade with other countries—primarily by promoting exports and encouraging investment in their nations. Borders that have fewer rules and regulations can help businesses expand easier and more cheaply. While this sounds great in theory, economists as well as businesspeople often ignore the realities of the political and sociocultural factors that impact relationships between countries, businesses, and people.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p04">Critics have longed argued that while the EU makes economic sense, it goes against the long-standing political, social, and cultural history, patterns, and differences existing throughout Europe. Not until the 2010 economic crisis in Greece did these differences become so apparent.</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="simpara">What Really Happened in Greece?</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p05">What is the European debt crisis? While experts continue to debate the causes of the crisis, it’s clear that several European countries had been borrowing beyond their capacity.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p06">Let’s look at one such country, Greece, which received a lot of press attention in 2010 and has been considered to have a very severe problem. The financial crisis in the EU, in large part, began in Greece, which had concealed the true levels of its debts. Once the situation in Greece came to light, investors began focusing on the debt levels of other EU countries.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p07">In April 2010, following a series of tax increases and budget cuts, the Greek prime minister officially announced that his country needed an international bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with its debt crisis.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p08">The crisis began in 2009 when the country faced its first negative economic growth rate since 1993. There was a fast-growing crisis, and the country couldn’t make its debt payments. Its debt costs were rising because investors and bankers became wary of lending more money to the country and demanded higher rates. Economic historians have accused the country of covering up just how bad the deficits were with a massive deficit revision of the 2009 budget.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p09">This drastic bailout was necessitated by the country’s massive budget deficits, the economy’s lack of transparency, and its excess corruption. In Greece, corruption has been so widespread that it’s an ingrained part of the culture. Greeks have routinely used the terms <em class="emphasis">fakelaki</em>, which means bribes offered in envelopes, and <em class="emphasis">rousfeti</em>, which means political favors among friends. Compared with its European member countries, Greece has suffered from high levels of political and economic corruption and low global-business competitiveness.</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="simpara">What’s the Impact on Europe and the EU?</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p10">In the ashes of Europe’s debt crisis, some see the seeds of long-term hope. That’s because the threat of bankruptcy is forcing governments to implement reforms that economists argue are necessary to help Europe prosper in a globalized world—but were long viewed politically impossible because of entrenched social attitudes. “Together, Europe’s banks have funneled $2.5 trillion into the five shakiest euro-zone economies: Greece, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_002">Stefan Theil, “Worse Than Wall Street,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, July 2, 2010, accessed December 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/02/worse-than-wall-street.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/02/worse-than-wall-street.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p11">So if it’s just a handful of European countries, why should the other stronger economies in the EU worry? Well, all of the sixteen member countries that use the euro as their currency now have their economies <em class="emphasis">interlinked</em> in a way that other countries don’t. Countries that have joined the euro currency have unique challenges when economic times are tough. A one-size-fits-all monetary policy doesn’t give the member countries the flexibility needed to stimulate their economies. (<a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch07#fwk-168388-ch07">Chapter 6 "International Monetary System"</a> discusses monetary policy in greater detail.) But the impact of one currency for sixteen markets has made countries like Portugal, Spain, and Greece less cost competitive on a global level. In practice, companies in these countries have to pay their wages and costs in euros, which makes their products and services more expensive than goods from cheaper, low-wage countries such as Poland, Turkey, China, and Brazil. Because they share a single common currency, highly indebted EU countries can’t just devalue their currency to stimulate exports.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p12">Rigid EU rules don’t enable member governments to navigate their country-specific problems, such as deficit spending and public works projects. Of note, a majority of the sixteen countries in the monetary union have completely disregarded the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact by running excessive deficits—that is, borrowing or spending more than the country has in its coffers. Reducing deficits and cutting social programs often comes at a high political cost.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p13">As Steven Erlanger noted in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>,</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p14">The European Union and the 16 nations that use the euro face two crises. One is the immediate problem of too much debt and government spending. Another is the more fundamental divide, roughly north and south, between the more competitive export countries like Germany and France and the uncompetitive, deficit countries that have adopted the high wages and generous social protections of the north without the same economic ethos of strict work habits, innovation, more flexible labor markets and high productivity.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p15">As Europe grapples with its financial crisis, the more competitive, wealthier countries are reluctantly rescuing more profligate economies, including Greece and Ireland, from fiscal and bank woes, while imposing drastic cuts in spending there.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_003">Steven Erlanger, “Euro Zone Is Imperiled by North-South Divide,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, December 2, 2010, accessed January 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/world/europe/03divide.html?_r=1&amp;ref=stevenerlanger">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/world/europe/03divide.html?_r=1&amp;ref=stevenerlanger</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p16">Early on, EU critics had expressed concern that countries wouldn’t want to give up their sovereign right to make economic and political policy. Efforts to create a European constitution and move closer to a political union fell flat in 2005, when Belgium and France rejected the efforts. Critics suggest that a political union is just not culturally feasible. European countries have deep, intertwined histories filled with cultural and ethnic biases, old rivalries, and deep-rooted preferences for their own sovereignty and independence. This first major economic crisis has brought this issue to the forefront.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p17">There were two original arguments against the creation of the EU and euro zone: (1) fiscal independence and sovereignty and (2) centuries-old political, economic, social, and cultural issues, biases, and differences.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p18">Despite these historical challenges, most Europeans felt that the devastation of two world wars were worse. World War I started as a result of the cumulative and somewhat convoluted sequence of political, economic, and military rivalries between European countries and then added in Japan and the United States. World War II started after Germany, intent on expanding its empire throughout Europe, invaded Poland in 1939. All told, these two wars led to almost one hundred million military and civilian deaths, shattered economies, destroyed industries, and severely demoralized and exhausted the global population. European and global leaders were determined that there would never be another world war. This became the early foundations of today’s global and regional economic and political alliances, in particular the EU and the United Nations (UN).</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p19">Of course, any challenges to the modern-day EU have brought back old rivalries and biases between nations. Strong economies, like Germany, have been criticized for condescending to the challenges in Greece, for example when German commentators used negative Greek stereotypes. Germany was also initially criticized for possibly holding up a bailout of Greece, because it was unpopular with German voters.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p20">European leaders first joined with the IMF in May 2010 and agreed on a $1 trillion rescue fund for financially troubled countries. Then, Greece announced deep budget cuts, Spain cut employer costs, and France raised its retirement age. France also joined Germany and the United Kingdom in imposing harsh budget cuts. Governments now face a crucial test of political will. Can they implement the reforms they’ve announced? The short-term response to those moves has been a wave of strikes, riots, and—in Spain, Italy, Ireland, and France—demonstrations.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p21">Yet supporters of the EU argue that the mutual common interests of the EU countries will ensure that reforms are implemented. Memories of the fragility of the continent after the wars still lingers. Plus, more realistically, Europeans know that in order to remain globally competitive, they will be stronger as a union than as individual countries—particularly when going up against such formidable economic giants as the United States and China.</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="simpara">What Does This All Mean for Businesses?</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p22">The first and most relevant reminder is that global business and trade are intertwined with the political, economic, and social realities of countries. This understanding has led to an expansion of trade agreements and country blocs, all based on the fundamental premise that peace, stability, and trade are interdependent. Both the public and private sectors have embraced this thinking.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p23">Despite the crises in varying European countries, businesses still see opportunity. UK-based Diageo, the giant global beverage company and maker of Ireland’s famous Guinness beer, just opened a new distillery in Roseisle, Scotland, located in the northern part of the United Kingdom.</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_bl02">
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p24">The new distillery is a symbol of optimism for the industry after the uncertainty of the global economic downturn. The scotch industry had been riding high when the financial crisis hit and the subsequent collapse in demand in 2009 ricocheted through important markets like South Korea, where sales contracted by almost 25 percent. Sales in Spain and Singapore were down 5 percent and 9 percent respectively. There was also evidence of drinkers trading down to cheaper spirits—such as hard-up Russians returning to vodka.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p25">David Gates, global category director for whiskies at Diageo, says emerging markets are leading the recovery: “The places we’re seeing demand pick up quickest are Asia, Latin America and parts of Eastern Europe. Southern Europe is more concerning because Spain and Greece, which are big scotch markets, remain in very difficult economic situations.”…</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p26">The renaissance of Scotland’s whisky industry has had little to do with Scottish consumption. Drinks groups have concentrated on the emerging middle-class in countries such as Brazil, where sales shot up 44 percent last year.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p27">In Mexico whisky sales were up 25 percent as locals defected from tequila.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_004">Zoe Wood, “Diageo Opens the First Major New Whisky Distillery for a Generation,” <em class="emphasis">Guardian</em>, October 3, 2010, accessed January 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/oct/03/diageo-roseisle-distillery-opens">http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/oct/03/diageo-roseisle-distillery-opens</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p29">It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world’s largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more porous to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area….</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p30">For free-market liberals, the enlarged union’s size and diversity is itself an advantage. By taking in eastern countries with lower labour costs and workers who are far more mobile than their western cousins, the EU in effect brought globalisation within its own borders.

        <h3 class="title">Understanding the Basics of Why Countries Borrow Money</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p31">Governments operate first from tax revenues before resorting to borrowing. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Brunei, or Qatar that have huge tax revenues from oil don’t need to borrow. However, countries that don’t have these huge tax revenues might need to borrow money. In addition, if tax revenues go down—for example in a recession or because taxes aren’t paid or aren’t collected properly—then countries might need to borrow.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p32">Countries usually borrow for four main reasons:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Recession.</strong> During a recession, a country may need to borrow money in order to keep its basic public services operating until the economy improves and businesses and workers can resume paying sufficient tax revenues to make borrowing less of a need.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Investment.</strong> A country may borrow money in order to invest in the public sector and build infrastructure, which may be anything related to keeping a society operating, including roads, airports, telecommunications, schools, and hospitals.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">War.</strong> A country may borrow in order to fund wars or military expansion.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Politics.</strong> A country may borrow money in order to reduce tax rates either because of political pressure from its citizens and businesses or to stimulate its economy. Usually countries have a much harder time cutting government spending. People don’t want to give up a benefit or service or, in the case of a recession, may need the services, such as food stamps or unemployment benefits, thus making it very difficult to cut government programs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p33">When countries borrow, they increase their debt. When debt levels become too high, investors get concerned that the country may not be able to repay the money. As a result, investors and bankers (in the form of the credit market) may view the debt as higher risk. Then, investors or bankers ask for a higher interest rate or return as compensation for the higher risk. This, in turn, leads to higher borrowing costs for the country.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p34">The national deficit is the amount of borrowing that a country does from either the private sector or other countries. However, the national deficit is different from the current account deficit, which refers to imports being greater than exports.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s00_p35">Even healthy countries run national deficits. For example, in the case of borrowing to invest long term in domestic facilities and programs, the rationale is that a country is investing in its future by improving infrastructure, much like a business would borrow to build a new factory.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_p01">In the post–World War II environment, countries came to realize that a major component of achieving any level of global peace was global cooperation—politically, economically, and socially. The intent was to level the trade playing field and reduce economic areas of disagreement, since inequality in these areas could lead to more serious conflicts. Among the initiatives, nations agreed to work together to promote free trade, entering into bilateral and multilateral agreements. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) resulted from these agreements. In this section, you’ll review GATT—why it was created and what its historical successes and challenges are. You’ll then look at the World Trade Organization (WTO), which replaced GATT in 1995, and study the impact of both these organizations on international trade. While GATT started as a set of rules between countries, the WTO has become an institution overseeing international trade.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</a><span class="glossdef">A series of rules governing trade that were first created in 1947 by twenty-three countries.</span></span> is a series of rules governing trade that were first created in 1947 by twenty-three countries. By the time it was replaced with the WTO, there were 125 member nations. GATT has been credited with substantially expanding global trade, primarily through the reduction of tariffs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s01_p02">The basic underlying principle of GATT was that trade should be free and equal. In other words, countries should open their markets equally to member nations, and there should be neither discrimination nor preferential treatment. One of GATT’s key provisions was the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">most-favored-nation clause (MFN)</a><span class="glossdef">A GATT provision that required member countries to automatically extend to all member countries the same benefits, usually tariff reductions, they agreed on with any other countries.</span></span>. It required that once a benefit, usually a tariff reduction, was agreed on between two or more countries, it was automatically extended to all other member countries. GATT’s initial focus was on tariffs, which are taxes placed on imports or exports.</p>

            <p class="simpara">MFN Is Everywhere</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s01_p03">As a concept, MFN can be seen in many aspects of business; it’s an important provision. Companies require MFN of their trading partners for pricing, access, and other provisions. Corporate or government customers require it of the company from which they purchase goods or services. Venture capitalists (VC) require it of the companies in which they invest. For example, a VC wants to make sure that it has negotiated the best price for equity and will ask for this provision in case another financier negotiates a cheaper purchase price for the equity. The idea behind the concept of MFN is that the country, company, or entity that has MFN status shouldn’t be disadvantaged in comparison with others in similar roles as a trading partner, buyer, or investor. In practice, the result is that the signing party given MFN status benefits from any better negotiation and receives the cheaper price point or better term. This terminology is also used in sales contracts or other business legal agreements.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s01_p04">Gradually, the GATT member countries turned their attention to other nontariff trade barriers. These included government procurement and bidding, industrial standards, subsidies, duties and customs, taxes, and licensing. GATT countries agreed to limit or remove trade barriers in these areas. The only agreed-on export subsidies were for agricultural products. Countries agreed to permit a wider range of imported products to enter their home markets by simplifying licensing guidelines and developing consistent product standards between imports and domestically produced goods. Duties had to result from uniform and consistent procedures for the same foreign and domestically produced items.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s01_p05">The initial successes in these categories led some countries to get more creative with developing barriers to trade as well as entering into bilateral agreements and providing more creative subsidies for select industries. The challenge for the member countries of GATT was enforcement. Other than complaining and retaliating, there was little else that a country could do to register disapproval of another country’s actions and trade barriers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s01_p06">Gradually, trade became more complex, leading to the Uruguay Round beginning in 1986 and ending in 1994. These trade meetings were called rounds in reference to the series of meetings among global peers held at a “roundtable.” Prior to a round, each series of trade discussions began in one country. The round of discussions was then named after that country. It sometimes took several years to conclude the topic discussions for a round. The Uruguay Round took eight years and actually resulted in the end of GATT and the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The current Doha Development Round began in 2001 and is actually considered part of the WTO.</p>

Formed officially on January 1, 1995, the concept of the WTO had been in development for several years. When the WTO replaced GATT, it absorbed all of GATT’s standing agreements. In contrast to GATT, which was a series of agreements, the WTO was designed to be an actual institution charged with the mission of promoting free and fair trade. As explained on its website, the WTO “is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world’s trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is to help producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers conduct their business.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_006">“What Is the WTO?,” World Trade Organization, accessed December 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/whatis_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/whatis_e.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p02">The global focus on multilateral trade agreements and cooperation has expanded trade exponentially. “The past 50 years have seen an exceptional growth in world trade. Merchandise exports grew on average by 6 percent annually. Total trade in 2000 was 22-times the level of 1950. GATT and the WTO have helped to create a strong and prosperous trading system contributing to unprecedented growth.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_007">“The Multilateral Trading System—Past, Present and Future,” World Trade Organization, accessed December 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/inbrief_e/inbr01_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/inbrief_e/inbr01_e.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p03">The WTO’s primary purpose is to serve as a negotiating forum for member nations to dispute, discuss, and debate trade-related matters. More than just a series of trade agreements, as it was under GATT, the WTO undertakes discussions on issues related to globalization and its impact on people and the environment, as well as trade-specific matters. It doesn’t necessarily establish formal agreements in all of these areas but does provide a forum to discuss how global trade impacts other aspects of the world.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p04">Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the current round is called the Doha Round and began in 2001. With 153 member nations, the WTO is the largest, global trade organization. Thirty nations have observer status, and many of these are seeking membership. With so many member nations, the concept of MFN has been eased into a new principle of normal trade relations (NTR). Advocates say that no nation really has a favored nation status; rather, all interact with each other as a normal part of global trade.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p05">The biggest change from GATT to the WTO is the provision for the settlement of disputes. If a country finds another country’s trade practices unfair or discriminatory, it may bring the charges to the WTO, which will hear from both countries and mediate a solution.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p06">The WTO has also undertaken the effort to focus on services rather than just goods. Resulting from the Uruguay Round, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) seeks to reduce the barriers to trade in services. Following the GATT commitment to nondiscrimination, GATS requires member nations to treat foreign service companies as they would domestic ones. For example, if a country requires banks to maintain 10 percent of deposits as reserves, then this percentage should be the same for foreign and domestic banks. Services have proven to be more complex to both define and regulate, and the member nations are continuing the discussions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p07">Similar to GATS is the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Intellectual property refers to just about anything that a person or entity creates with the mind. It includes inventions, music, art, and writing, as well as words, phrases, sayings, and graphics—to name a few. The basic premise of intellectual property rights (IPR) law is that the creator of the property has the right to financially benefit from his or her creation. This is particularly important for protecting the development for the creation, known as the research and development (R&amp;D) costs. Companies can also own the intellectual property that their employees generate. This section focuses on the protection that countries agree to give to intellectual property created in another country. (For more information on IPR, see <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch13#fwk-168388-ch13">Chapter 13 "Harnessing the Engine of Global Innovation"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch13_s02#fwk-168388-ch13_s02">Section 13.2 "Intellectual Property Rights around the Globe"</a>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p08">Over the past few decades, companies have become increasingly diligent in protecting their intellectual property and pursuing abusers. Whether it’s the knock-off designer handbag from China that lands on the sidewalks of New York or the writer protecting her thoughts in the written words of a book (commonly understood as content), or the global software company combating piracy of its technical know-how, IPR is now formally a part of the WTO agreements and ongoing dialogue.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p01">Agriculture and textiles are two key sectors in which the WTO faces challenges. Trade in agriculture has been impacted by export-country subsidies, import-country tariffs and restrictions, and nontariff barriers. Whether the United States provides low-cost loans and subsidies to its farmers or Japan restricts the beef imports, agriculture trade barriers are an ongoing challenge for the WTO. Global companies and trade groups that support private-sector firms seek to have their governments raise critical trade issues on their behalf through the WTO.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p02">For example, Japan’s ban of beef imports in response to mad cow disease has had a heavy impact on the US beef industry.</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p04">The U.S. beef industry is losing about $1 billion a year in sales because of the restrictions, according to the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, [a trade group supporting the interests of American beef producers]. Japan was the largest foreign buyer of U.S. beef before it banned all imports when the first case of the brain-wasting disease, also known bovine spongiform encephalopathy [i.e., mad cow disease], was discovered in the U.S.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p08">The role of the WTO is to facilitate agreements in difficult bilateral and multilateral trade disputes, but this certainly isn’t easy. Japan’s reluctance for American beef may appear to be the result of mad cow disease, but business observers note Japan’s historical cultural preference for Japanese goods, which the country often claims are superior. A similar trade conflict was triggered in the 1980s when Japan discouraged the import of rice from other countries. The prevailing Japanese thought was that its local rice was easier for the Japanese to digest. After extensive discussions in the Uruguay Round, on “December 14, 1993 the Japanese government accepted a limited opening of the rice market under the GATT plan.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_009">“Japan Rice Trade,” case study on American University website, accessed January 2, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www1.american.edu/ted/japrice.htm">http://www1.american.edu/ted/japrice.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p09">Antidumping is another area on which the WTO has focused its attention. Dumping occurs when a company exports to a foreign market at a price that is either lower than the domestic prices in that country or less than the cost of production. Antidumping charges can be harder to settle, as the charge is against a company and not a country. One example is in India, which has, in the past, accused Japan and Thailand of dumping acetone, a chemical used in drugs and explosives, in the Indian market. In an effort to protect domestic manufacturers, India has raised the issue with the WTO. In fact, India was second only to Argentina among the G-20 (or Group of Twenty) nations in initiating antidumping investigations during 2009, according to a recent WTO report.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_010">Press Trust of India, “Govt Initiates Anti-Dumping Probe against Acetone Imports,” <em class="emphasis">Business Standard</em>, November 3, 2009, accessed December 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/govt-initiates-anti-dumping-probe-against-acetone-imports/375153/">http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/govt-initiates-anti-dumping-probe-against-acetone-imports/375153/</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_p02">There are four main types of regional economic integration.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Free trade area.</strong> This is the most basic form of economic cooperation. Member countries remove all barriers to trade between themselves but are free to independently determine trade policies with nonmember nations. An example is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customs union.</strong> This type provides for economic cooperation as in a free-trade zone. Barriers to trade are removed between member countries. The primary difference from the free trade area is that members agree to treat trade with nonmember countries in a similar manner.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Common market.</strong> This type allows for the creation of economically integrated markets between member countries. Trade barriers are removed, as are any restrictions on the movement of labor and capital between member countries. Like customs unions, there is a common trade policy for trade with nonmember nations. The primary advantage to workers is that they no longer need a visa or work permit to work in another member country of a common market.

A trade bloc is basically a free-trade zone, or near-free-trade zone, formed by one or more tax, tariff, and trade agreements between two or more countries. Some trading blocs have resulted in agreements that have been more substantive than others in creating economic cooperation. Of course, there are pros and cons for creating regional agreements.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Pros</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">The pros of creating regional agreements include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trade creation.</strong> These agreements create more opportunities for countries to trade with one another by removing the barriers to trade and investment. Due to a reduction or removal of tariffs, cooperation results in cheaper prices for consumers in the bloc countries. Studies indicate that regional economic integration significantly contributes to the relatively high growth rates in the less-developed countries.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employment opportunities.</strong> By removing restrictions on labor movement, economic integration can help expand job opportunities.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consensus and cooperation.</strong> Member nations may find it easier to agree with smaller numbers of countries. Regional understanding and similarities may also facilitate closer political cooperation.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Cons</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p01">The cons involved in creating regional agreements include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trade diversion.</strong> The flip side to trade creation is trade diversion. Member countries may trade more with each other than with nonmember nations. This may mean increased trade with a less efficient or more expensive producer because it is in a member country. In this sense, weaker companies can be protected inadvertently with the bloc agreement acting as a trade barrier. In essence, regional agreements have formed new trade barriers with countries outside of the trading bloc.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employment shifts and reductions.</strong> Countries may move production to cheaper labor markets in member countries. Similarly, workers may move to gain access to better jobs and wages. Sudden shifts in employment can tax the resources of member countries.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Loss of national sovereignty.</strong> With each new round of discussions and agreements within a regional bloc, nations may find that they have to give up more of their political and economic rights. In the opening case study, you learned how the economic crisis in Greece is threatening not only the EU in general but also the rights of Greece and other member nations to determine their own domestic economic policies.</li>

            <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Brief History and Purpose</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into being during a period when free trade and trading blocs were popular and positively perceived. In 1988, the United States and Canada signed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement. Shortly after it was approved and implemented, the United States started to negotiate a similar agreement with Mexico. When Canada asked to be party to any negotiations to preserve its rights under the most-favored-nation clause (MFN), the negotiations began for NAFTA, which was finally signed in 1992 and implemented in 1994.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p02">The goal of NAFTA has been to encourage trade between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. By reducing tariffs and trade barriers, the countries hope to create a free-trade zone where companies can benefit from the transfer of goods. In the 1980s, Mexico had tariffs as high as 100 percent on select goods. Over the first decade of the agreement, almost all tariffs between Mexico, Canada, and the United States were phased out.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p03">The rules governing origin of content are key to NAFTA. As a free trade agreement, the member countries can establish their own trading rules for nonmember countries. NAFTA’s rules ensure that a foreign exporter won’t just ship to the NAFTA country with the lowest tariff for nonmember countries. NAFTA rules require that at least 50 percent of the net cost of most products must come from or be incurred in the NAFTA region. There are higher requirements for footwear and cars. For example, this origin of content rule has ensured that cheap Asian manufacturers wouldn’t negotiate lower tariffs with one NAFTA country, such as Mexico, and dump cheap products into Canada and the United States. Mexican <em class="emphasis">maquiladoras</em> have fared well in this arrangement by being the final production stop before entering the United States or Canada. <em class="emphasis">Maquiladoras</em> are production facilities located in border towns in Mexico that take imported materials and produce the finished good for export, primarily to Canada or the United States.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Current Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">Canadian and US consumers have benefited from the lower-cost Mexican agricultural products. Similarly, Canadian and US companies have sought to enter the expanding Mexican domestic market. Many Canadian and US companies have chosen to locate their manufacturing or production facilities in Mexico rather than Asia, which was geographically far from their North American bases.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s02_p02">When it was introduced, NAFTA was highly controversial, particularly in the United States, where many felt it would send US jobs to Mexico. In the long run, NAFTA hasn’t been as impactful as its supporters had hoped nor as detrimental to workers and companies as its critics had feared. As part of NAFTA, two side agreements addressing labor and environmental standards were put into place. The expectation was that these side agreements would ensure that Mexico had to move toward improving working conditions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s02_p03">Mexico has fared the best from NAFTA as trade has increased dramatically. <em class="emphasis">Maquiladoras</em> in Mexico have seen a 15 percent annual increase in income. By and large, Canadians have been supportive of NAFTA and exports to the region have increased in the period since implementation. “Tri-lateral [merchandise] trade has nearly tripled since NAFTA came into force in 1994. It topped $1 trillion in 2008.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_015">Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, “Fast Facts: North American Free Trade Agreement,” December 15, 2009, accessed December 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/nafta-alena/fast_facts-faits_saillants.aspx?lang=eng">http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/nafta-alena/fast_facts-faits_saillants.aspx?lang=eng</a>.</span></p>

In the opening case study, you read about the pressures on the EU and the resistance by each of the governments in Europe to make policy adjustments to address the recession. The United States, as the largest country member in NAFTA, won’t give up its rights to independently determine its economic and trade policies.

                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p02">The Mexican economy has undergone dramatic changes during the last decade and a half as the country has become integrated into the global marketplace. Once highly protected, Mexico is now open for business. Successive governments have instituted far-reaching economic reforms, which have had a major impact on the way business is conducted. The scale of business has changed as well. Forced to compete with large multinationals and Mexican conglomerates, many traditional family-owned firms have had to close because they were unable to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p03">NAFTA has added to the already-strong US influence on Mexico’s corporate and business practices. In particular, competitiveness and efficiency have become higher priorities, although company owners and managers still like to surround themselves with people they know and to groom their sons and sometimes their daughters to be their successors. US influence is also pervasive in the products and services offered throughout Mexico.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p04">Mexico has always had a strong entrepreneurial business culture, but until NAFTA, it was protected from the pressures of international finance and the global marketplace. Business and particularly interpersonal business relationships were viewed as something that should be pleasurable, like other important aspects of life.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p05">Long-term relationships are still the foundation on which trust is established and business is built. In Mexico, patience and the willingness to wait are still highly valued—and necessary—in business transactions. This is slowly changing, spurred in part by an aggressive cadre of young professionals who pursued graduate education in the United States.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p06">Since the mid-1960s, production facilities known as <em class="emphasis">maquiladoras</em> have been a regular feature of Mexican border towns, especially along the Texas and New Mexico borders. US multinational companies, such as John Deere, Zenith, Mattel, and Xerox, run the majority of the more than 3,600 maquiladoras in northern Mexico. Billions of dollars’ worth of products—from televisions to clothes to auto parts—are assembled in maquiladoras and then shipped back, tax free, to the United States for sale to US consumers.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p07">Maquiladoras employ more than a million Mexicans, mostly unskilled women in their twenties and early thirties who work long hours. Wages and benefits are generally poor but much better than in the rest of Mexico. The huge growth in trade between the United States and Mexico has greatly expanded the role—and scale—of these assembly operations.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p08">Along with the benefits, challenges have also come with the increased trade. A large number of Mexicans are concerned that wealth is distributed more unevenly than ever. For example, many commentators see the political situation in the state of Chiapas as underscoring the alienation large groups have suffered as a result of the opening of the Mexican economy to global forces. A rural region in southern Mexico, Chiapas is home to extremely poor Mayan, Ch’ol, Zoque, and Lacandón Indians. Although it is the poorest state in Mexico, Chiapas has the richest natural resources, including oil, minerals, and electrical power.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p09">On January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA officially took effect, a group of Indian peasants, commanded by Subcomandante Marcos, rose up in armed rebellion. This was shocking not only to Mexico’s leadership but to the international community. The unrest in Chiapas stems from long-standing economic and social injustice in the region and from the Indians’ isolation and exploitation by the local oligarchy of landowners and mestizo bosses (<em class="emphasis">caciques</em>). While NAFTA clearly advanced the goals of free trade, global businesses are often forced to deal with local economic, political, and social realities within a country.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p10">The Mexican government has indicated that improving the social conditions in the region is a high priority. However, only partial accords have been reached between the government and the peasants. At the same time, the army continues to exert tight control over the state, particularly in and around towns where residents are known to support the rebels.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p11">The low standard of living in Chiapas and of Indians throughout Mexico remains a significant challenge for the Mexican government. In the years following the Chiapas uprising, poverty in southern Mexico has risen to about 40 percent, while in the north, poverty has decreased thanks to closer economic links with the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_019"><em class="emphasis">CultureQuest Doing Business in Mexico</em> (New York: Atma Global, 2011).</span></p>

Originally, the agreement (then called the Central America Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA) encompassed discussions between the US and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. A year before the official signing, the Dominican Republic joined the negotiations, and the agreement was renamed CAFTA-DR.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_025">“Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR),” Export.gov, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.export.gov/FTA/cafta-dr/index.asp">http://www.export.gov/FTA/cafta-dr/index.asp</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s03_s02_p02">The goal of the agreement is the creation of a free trade area similar to NAFTA. For free trade advocates, the CAFTA-DR is also seen as a stepping stone toward the eventual establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)—the more ambitious grouping for a free trade agreement that would encompass all the South American and Caribbean nations as well as those of North and Central America (except Cuba). Canada is currently negotiating a similar treaty called the Canada Central American Free Trade Agreement. It’s likely that any resulting agreements will have to reconcile differences in rules and regulations with NAFTA as well as any other existing agreements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_026">“What Is CAFTA?,” CAFTA Intelligence Center, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.caftaintelligencecenter.com/subpages/What_is_CAFTA.asp">http://www.caftaintelligencecenter.com/subpages/What_is_CAFTA.asp</a>.</span></p>

With the removal of virtually all tariffs and other barriers to trade, the CAFTA-DR agreement is making commerce with these countries even easier, opening opportunities to a range of industries. At the same time, it’s making the CAFTA-DR countries richer and increasing the purchasing power of their citizens.</p>

And within the United States, no location is as well positioned as Florida to act as the gateway to the CAFTA-DR markets. For a variety of reasons—from geography and language to well-developed business and family connections—this is a role that Florida has been playing very successfully for a number of years and which, with the implementation of CAFTA-DR, is only gaining in importance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_028">Enterprise Florida, “Your Business: International,” The CAFTA Intelligence Center, accessed December 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.caftaintelligencecenter.com/subpages/location-International.asp">http://www.caftaintelligencecenter.com/subpages/location-International.asp</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p01">The European Union (EU) is the most integrated form of economic cooperation. As you learned in the opening case study, the EU originally began in 1950 to end the frequent wars between neighboring countries in the Europe. The six founding nations were France, West Germany, Italy, and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Benelux countries</a><span class="glossdef">The grouping of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.</span></span> (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), all of which signed a treaty to run their coal and steel industries under a common management. The focus was on the development of the coal and steel industries for peaceful purposes.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p02">In 1957, the six nations signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and created a common market between the members. Over the next fifty years, the EEC added nine more members and changed its name twice—to European Community (EC) in the 1970s and the European Union (EU) in 1993.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_029">“History of the European Union,” Europa, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm">http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p03">The entire history of the transformation of the EEC to the EU has been an evolutionary process. However, the Treaty of Maastricht in 1993 stands out as an important moment; it’s when the <em class="emphasis">real</em> economic union was created. With this treaty, the EU identified three aims. The first was to establish a single, common currency, which went into effect in 1999. The second was to set up monetary and fiscal targets for member countries. Third, the treaty called for a political union, which would include the development of a common foreign and defense policy and common citizenship. The opening case study addressed some of the current challenges the EU is facing as a result of the impact of these aims. Despite the challenges, the EU is likely to endure given its historic legacy. Furthermore, a primary goal for the development of the EU was that Europeans realized that they needed a larger trading platform to compete against the US and the emerging markets of China and India. Individually, the European countries would never have the economic power they now have collectively as the EU.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p04">Today, the EU has twenty-seven member countries. Croatia, Iceland, Macedonia, and Turkey are the next set of candidates for future membership. In 2009, the twenty-seven EU countries signed the Treaty of Lisbon, which amends the previous treaties. It is designed to make the EU more democratic, efficient, and transparent and to tackle global challenges, such as climate change, security, and sustainable development.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s02_s04_s01_p05">The European Economic Area (EEA) was established on January 1, 1994, following an agreement between the member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EC (later the EU). Specifically, it has allowed Iceland (now an EU candidate), Liechtenstein, and Norway to participate in the EU’s single market without a conventional EU membership. Switzerland has also chosen to not join the EU, although it is part of similar bilateral agreements.</p>

Since its launch, the euro has become the world’s second-largest reserve currency behind the US dollar. It’s important to remember several distinctions. First, the EU doesn’t consist of the same countries as the continent of Europe. Second, there are more EU member countries than there are countries using the euro.

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Do These Trade Agreements and Efforts Impact Business?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s03_p01">Overall, global businesses have benefited from the regional trade agreements by having more consistent criteria for investment and trade as well as reduced barriers to entry. Companies that choose to manufacture in one country find it easier and cheaper to move goods between member countries in that trading bloc without incurring tariffs or additional regulations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s03_p02">The challenges for businesses include finding themselves outside of a new trading bloc or having the “rules” for their industry change as a result of new trade agreements. Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. It’s often called a “spaghetti bowl” of global bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, because the agreements are not linear strands lining up neatly; instead they are a messy mix of crisscrossing strands, like a bowl of spaghetti, that link countries and trading blocs in self-benefiting trading alliances. Businesses have to monitor and navigate these evolving trade agreements to make sure that one or more agreements don’t negatively impact their businesses in key countries. This is one reason why global businesses have teams of in-house professionals monitoring the WTO as well as the regional trade alliances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s02_s03_p03">For example, American companies doing business in one of the ASEAN countries often choose to become members of the US–ASEAN Business Council, so that they can monitor and possibly influence new trade regulations as well as advance their business interests with government entities.</p>

Staffed with lawyers in an advocacy department, global firms work to maintain relationships with all of the interested parties.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p02">It’s worth noting that there is a wide range of businesses that benefit from war—for example, companies in industries that manufacture arms, plastics, clothing (uniforms), and a wide range of supplies and logistics. Companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Finmeccanica, Thales Group, General Dynamics, KBR (Halliburton), Rolls-Royce, Boeing, and Honeywell are just some of the world’s largest companies in this sector, and all receive benefits that are woven into economic and trade policy from their respective governments directly as well as through general preferences in trade policies and agreements.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p05">Nevertheless, military conflict can be extremely disruptive to economic activity and impede long-term economic performance. As a result, most global businesses find that operating in stable environments leads to the best business operations for a range of reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Staffing.</strong> It’s easier to recruit skilled labor if the in-country conditions are stable and relatively risk-free. Look at the challenges companies have in recruiting nonmilitary personnel to work in the fledging private sectors of Iraq or Afghanistan. Even development organizations have been challenged to send in skilled talent to develop banking-, finance-, and service-sector initiatives. Historically, regardless of which country or conflict, development staff has only been sent into a country after stability has been secured by military force. Companies have to pay even higher levels of hardship and risk pay and may still not necessarily be able to bring in the best talent.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Operations.</strong> In unstable environments, companies fear loss or damage to property and investment. For example, goods in transit can easily be stolen, and factories or warehouses can be damaged.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Regulations.</strong> Unclear and constantly changing business rules make it hard for firms to plan for the long term.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Currency convertibility and free-flowing capital.</strong> Often countries experiencing conflict often impose capital controls (i.e., restrictions on money going in and out of their countries) as well as find that their currency may be devalued or illiquid. Financial management is a key component of global business management. (<a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch07#fwk-168388-ch07">Chapter 6 "International Monetary System"</a> discusses the value of stable, liquid, and freely floating currencies, and <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch15#fwk-168388-ch15">Chapter 15 "Understanding the Roles of Finance and Accounting in Global Competitive Advantage"</a> covers financial management.)</li>

Furthermore, the largest global companies—Siemens, General Electric, Boeing, Airbus, and others—have the economic might to influence governments to promote initiatives to benefit their companies or industries.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Business in Conflict Zones: Angola and Conflict Diamonds</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p07">Angola, located in southern Africa, is a country that faced internal devastation from an intense civil war raging from its independence in 1975 until 2002. For many businesspeople, Angola may seem a relatively obscure country. However, it is the second-largest petroleum and diamond producer in sub-Saharan Africa. While the oil has brought economic success, the diamonds, known as conflict or blood diamonds, have garnered global attention. Even Hollywood has called attention to this illicit trade in a 2006 movie entitled <em class="emphasis">Blood Diamond</em> as well as numerous other movie plots focusing on conflict diamonds, including one in the James Bond franchise.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p08">So what are conflict diamonds? The United Nations (UN) defines them as follows:</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p09">Conflict diamonds are diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council….</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p10">Rough diamond caches have often been used by rebel forces to finance arms purchases and other illegal activities. Neighbouring and other countries can be used as trading and transit grounds for illicit diamonds. Once diamonds are brought to market, their origin is difficult to trace and once polished, they can no longer be identified.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_058">United Nations Department of Public Information in cooperation with the Sanctions Branch, Security Council Affairs Division, Department of Political Affairs, “Conflict Diamonds: Sanctions and War,” United Nations, March 21, 2001, accessed December 31, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/peace/africa/Diamond.html">http://www.un.org/peace/africa/Diamond.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p11">First discovered in 1912, diamonds are a key industry for Angola. During its twenty-seven years of conflict, which cost up to 1.5 million lives, rebel groups in Angola traded diamonds to fund armed conflict, hence the term <em class="emphasis">conflict diamonds</em>. Some estimate that Angola’s main rebel group, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), sold more than $3.72 billion in conflict diamonds to finance its war against the government.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_059"><em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, s.v. “Blood diamond,” last modified February 9, 2011, accessed February 15, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_diamond">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_diamond</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p13">In 1999, the UN applied sanctions to ban the Angolan rebels’ trade in conflict diamonds, but a portion of diamonds continued to be traded by the rebels. The UN conducted extensive investigations. “The Security Council’s diamond campaign is part of an ongoing UN effort to make sanctions more selective, better targeted and more rigorously enforced instruments for maintaining international peace and security.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_060">Michael Fleshman, “Targeting ‘Conflict Diamonds’ in Africa,” <em class="emphasis">Africa Recovery</em> 14, no. 4 (January 2001): 6, accessed December 31, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/144diam.htm">http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/144diam.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p14">Eventually, the UN, various governments, the diamond industry, and nongovernmental organizations, including Global Witness, Amnesty International, and Partnership Africa Canada (PAC), recognized the need for a global system to prevent conflict diamonds from entering the legitimate diamond supply chain and thus helping fund conflicts. The process that was established in 2003 provides for certification process to assure consumers that by purchasing certified diamonds they weren’t financing war and human rights abuses. As a result, seventy-four governments have adopted the Kimberley Process certification system, and more than 99 percent of the world’s diamonds are from conflict- free sources.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_061">World Diamond Council, “Eliminating Conflict Diamonds,” accessed December 31, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://diamondfacts.org/conflict/eliminating_conflict_diamonds.html#kim">http://diamondfacts.org/conflict/eliminating_conflict_diamonds.html#kim</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s01_p16">For example, South African De Beers is the world’s largest diamond mining and trading company. Prior to UN action and the Kimberley Process, De Beers was buying conflict diamonds from guerilla movements in three African countries, thereby financing regional conflicts. One UN investigation in Angola found that rebel forces bartered uncut diamonds for weaponry, thereby allowing the civil war to continue in 1998 despite international economic and diplomatic sanctions. In 1999, under UN pressure, De Beers decided to stop buying any outside diamonds in order to guarantee the conflict-free status of its diamond.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_062">Dick Durham, “De Beers Sees Threat of Blood Diamonds,” January 18, 2001, accessed April 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/01/18/diamonds.debeers/index.html">http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/01/18/diamonds.debeers/index.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s02_p01">The United Nations (UN) was formed in 1945 at the end of World War II to replace the League of Nations, which had been formed in 1919. Its original goals remain the same today: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations between nations; and to foster international cooperation in solving economic, social, humanitarian, and cultural issues. There is an underlying premise of human rights and equality. Almost all of the world’s countries are members—currently 192 nations—with only a few smaller territories and Taiwan, out of deference to China, given observer status and not membership. The UN is funded by member countries’ assessments and contributions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s02_p02">The work of the UN reaches every corner of the globe. Throughout the world, the UN and its agencies assist refugees, set up programs to clear landmines, help expand food production, and lead the fight against AIDS. They also help protect the environment, fight diseases, reduce poverty, and strive for better living standards and human rights. Although the UN is often best known for peacekeeping, peace building, conflict prevention, and humanitarian assistance, the organization also works on a broad range of fundamental social, economic, environment, and health issues. In the Ethics in Action sidebar on Angola, you learned how the UN led the way to resolving the problem of conflict diamonds and partnered with the global diamond industry to develop a long-term solution to a thorny ethical trading problem and promote peace and stability in former conflict countries like Angola.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s02_p03">A secretary-general leads the UN and serves for a five-year term. Structurally, the UN consists of six main bodies:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">General Assembly.</strong> This is the deliberative body of the UN and consists of all of the member countries that meet in regular sessions throughout the year. All of the members have an equal vote in the General Assembly.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Security Council.</strong> This body is responsible for addressing issues related to peace and security. It has fifteen members, five of which are permanent country representations—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and France. The remaining ten are elected by the General Assembly every two years. As you may expect, there’s a great deal of political wrangling by countries to be on the Security Council, which is deemed to have significant power. All decisions by the Security Council are supposed to be binding on the rest of the member nations of the UN.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).</strong> This body is responsible for issues related to economics, human rights, and social matters. A number of smaller commissions and specialized agencies carry out this council’s work. The ECOSOC works closely with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, both of which are covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch07#fwk-168388-ch07">Chapter 6 "International Monetary System"</a>.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Secretariat.</strong> The Secretariat oversees the operations of the UN and is technically headed by the Secretary-General</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">International Court of Justice.</strong> Located in The Hague, this body hears disputes between nations. The court consists of fifteen judges who are elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council. The court reviews cases concerning war crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and illegal interference by one country in the affairs of another, among others.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">UN Trusteeship Council.</strong> While an official part of the UN Charter charged with overseeing all trustee territories under UN custody, this body is currently inactive.</li>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch06_s03_s02_p04">A strong UN is the world’s most effective voice for international cooperation on behalf of peace, development, human rights, and the environment. The UN has also sought to forge partnerships outside of the traditional diplomatic arena. One such partnership that is of growing interest to private sector businesses is the UN Global Compact. This is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles. Why would companies want to align their businesses with these principles? For starters, some businesses see it as a way to be a good global corporate citizen, a label that they can use to attract and retain the best workforce as well as use in marketing efforts to exhibit their global corporate responsibility. The UN is motivated to engage the private sector in helping solve the world’s most pressing problems, often with for-profit solutions.</p>

Structured as a public-private initiative, the Global Compact offers a policy framework for the development, implementation, and disclosure of sustainability principles and practices related to its four core areas: human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Indeed, managing the enterprise risks and opportunities related to these areas is today a widely understood aspect of long-term “value creation”—value creation that can simultaneously benefit the private sector and societies at large.</p>

The company explains on its website, “In March 2006, The Coca-Cola Company became a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, affirming our commitment to the advancement of its 10 universal accepted principles…in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.

            <li>Based on what you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch04#fwk-168388-ch04">Chapter 3 "Culture and Business"</a> and this chapter, do you feel that countries enforce trade rules fairly? What factors might affect how one government interprets violations of trade rules? Using a sports analogy, is the WTO a fair referee for trade issues? Is the UN a fair referee for trade and other issues? Why or why not? Research the voting rules for each organization to support for your answer.</li>
            <li>Based on what you have learned about economic unions and the current issues facing the EU, do you think that NAFTA could become an economic union in the foreseeable future? Why or why not? Use your understanding of economic and monetary unions as well as your understanding of the cultures of the countries in NAFTA. Review the two arguments against the EU as outlined in the opening case. How do you feel that culture, politics, society, and history would impact any possible economic union for NAFTA?</li>
            <li>The <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> highlighted the issue of conflict minerals in an article entitled “Retailers Fight to Escape ‘Conflict Minerals’ Law.” Retailers, including Walmart and Target, are protesting part of a new US law that requires companies to verify that products with minerals from Central Africa are not taxed or controlled by rebel regimes: “Some of the largest U.S. retailers argue they shouldn’t have to comply with the rule if they don’t exercise direct control over the manufacturing of goods carrying their own brands….Tracing the source of minerals is a tricky task, companies say, because many intermediaries stand between them and the mines.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn06_069">Jessica Holzer, “Retailers Fight to Escape Conflict Minerals Law,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, December 2, 2010, accessed January 2, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703865004575648992964733232.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703865004575648992964733232.html</a>.</span> Based on what you learned in this chapter and the sidebar on conflict diamonds in Angola, do you agree or disagree with the statement above and the retailers’ position? Why or why not? Should retailers that have their name on a product be responsible for how the product is made?</li>
