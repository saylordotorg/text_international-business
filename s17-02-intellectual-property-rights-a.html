        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p01">For companies to gain financial benefits from investing in research and coming up with new inventions, there must be legal protection for those inventions. The system of law related to R&amp;D and innovation is referred to as intellectual property rights. Different countries vary in the extent to which they protect intellectual property and enforce intellectual property regulations. The presence of strong, enforceable, consistent property rights serves to make the world flatter. However, as long as significant differences in property rights exist around the globe, the world will be far from flat with respect to innovation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Intellectual property (IP)</a><span class="glossdef">Creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce.</span></span> refers to creations of the mind—inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_026">“What Is Intellectual Property?,” World Intellectual Property Organization, 2003, accessed March 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/450/wipo_pub_450.pdf">http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/450/wipo_pub_450.pdf</a>.</span> The term <em class="emphasis">property</em> connotes ownership that’s exclusive, but the owners have the right to license or sell their IP. Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intellectual property rights (IPR)</a><span class="glossdef">The exclusive rights granted to owners for their intangible assets under intellectual property law.</span></span>—to the discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs they create.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p03">Let’s look at the ways companies protect their IP and profit from it. The simplest way for a company to protect its intellectual property is to never reveal it—to create what is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade secret</a><span class="glossdef">Any confidential business information which provides an enterprise with a competitive edge.</span></span>. This is how Coca-Cola protects the formula for its hugely popular soda. If the secret were discovered or revealed through nefarious intent, then trade secret law would allow punishment of the perpetrator, including criminal prosecution. But if a company somehow developed the same formula on its own, Coca-Cola could do nothing to stop them. Therefore, companies opt for other IP protection—namely, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">patents</a><span class="glossdef">Exclusive right granted for an invention, whether a product or a process, which must be industrially applicable (useful), be new (novel), and exhibit a sufficient “inventive step” (be nonobvious).</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">copyrights</a><span class="glossdef">The body of laws that grants authors, artists, and other creators protection for their literary and artistic creations, which are generally referred to as “works.”</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p04">The most common way to protect an industrial discovery or invention is to patent it. A patent is an inventor’s exclusive right granted by the government for an invention, whether a product or a process, that is industrially applicable (i.e., useful) or new (i.e., novel) or exhibits a sufficient “inventive step” (i.e., be nonobvious) To get a patent, the company must reveal the details of the invention. The rationale for revealing the invention details is so that others can build on the invention and thus promote further innovation. By revealing the invention, companies obtain legal protection and the right to exclusive sales of the invention (or the right to license or sell its use to others). The patent gives the patent owner a monopoly on the invention for a specific number of years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p05">Patents can be granted within a single country or internationally. Christian Hahner, head of Intellectual Property &amp; Technology Management at Daimler, said, “Attaining international patent protection is an expensive undertaking. If we believe it’s important for our business to actively defend our patent in court in order to prevent unauthorized copies or imitations, then we have to nationalize the patent, which makes it valid in other countries.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_027">Peter Thomas, “Patents Are the Future of Innovation Management,” <em class="emphasis">Technicity</em>, 2010, accessed February 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner">http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner</a>.</span> A patent prohibits other people from selling the identical product built in the same way as the accepted patent. Patents give the owner the right to defend the invention in court, but they don’t automatically mean that the owner will win the court case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p06">“When I make an innovation public in Germany by initially registering a patent, I’m actually defining the state of the art. It then becomes impossible for anyone else in the world to patent that innovation,” Hahner said. “The publication of the patent also creates conditions that enable the worldwide utilization of innovations with great value to society—like those related to vehicle safety, for example.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_028">Peter Thomas, “Patents Are the Future of Innovation Management.” <em class="emphasis">Technicity</em>, 2010, accessed February 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner">http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner</a>.</span> That is, by disclosing the invention publicly, the inventor gets legal protection from outright copying of the invention, but society also benefits because others learn about the invention and can try to devise a different, original way to achieve the same outcome. Because of this fear of copying, some companies, such as Microsoft, choose not to patent some of their products. For example, Microsoft does not have a patent on its Windows software because doing so would force it to reveal its source code, which Microsoft does not want to do.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p07">A car might have one hundred patents associated with it in various parts and components. In contrast, in the pharmaceutical industry, one patent may be all that’s needed to cover one product: a patented drug is the product in itself. What’s more, much of the innovation in new cars today resides in software. For example, the Chevrolet Volt has more software than a state-of-the-art fighter aircraft. Almost 40 percent of the car’s value comes from software, computer controls, and sensors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_029">Jason Paur, “Chevy Volt: King of (Software) Cars,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, November 5, 2010, accessed February 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/11/chevy-volt-king-of-software-cars">http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/11/chevy-volt-king-of-software-cars</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s02_p02">Some companies obtain patents mainly to license or sell them to others, thus making money from their inventions without having to manufacture or service anything themselves. In turn, other companies actively seek patents that they can purchase because they want to speed up their own R&amp;D efforts. For example, even Daimler, which registered 2,000 patents in 2009, pays 2,600 outside inventors to use their innovations in Daimler products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_032">Peter Thomas, “Patents Are the Future of Innovation Management,” <em class="emphasis">Technicity</em>, 2010, accessed February 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner">http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner</a>.</span> Filing patents is relatively inexpensive; even entrepreneurs can afford the filing fee. But defending a patent can be expensive. Given how overworked the patent examiners are, they often err on the side of granting a patent, which means that there are often overlapping patents. “We wind up in these fights over patents where we can’t tell what they mean, and the courts can’t tell what they mean, and even the patentees can’t tell you what they mean,” said David Kappos, a lawyer who managed IBM’s patent portfolio.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_033">Jeff Howe, <em class="emphasis">Crowdsourcing</em> (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2008), 65.</span></p>

China, which has been on the Watch List before, continues to be on the list not only because of IP theft and counterfeiting but also because of government practices that severely restrict the market for foreign goods while giving favored treatment to “indigenous innovation.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_036">United States Trade Representative, “USTR Releases 2010 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Rights,” press release, April 2010, accessed February 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2010/april/ustr-releases-2010-special-301-report-intellectual-p">http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2010/april/ustr-releases-2010-special-301-report-intellectual-p</a>.</span> Countries can get off the Watch List by taking measures to reduce IP theft.
