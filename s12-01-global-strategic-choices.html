        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_p01">The allure of global markets can be mesmerizing. Companies that operate in highly competitive or nearly saturated markets at home, for instance, are drawn to look overseas for expansion. But overseas expansion is not a decision to be made lightly, and managers must ask themselves whether the expansion will create real value for shareholders. Companies can easily underestimate the costs of entering new markets if they are not familiar with the new regions and the business practices common within the new regions. For some companies, a misstep in a foreign market can put their entire operations in jeopardy, as happened to French retailer Carrefour after their failed entry into Chile, which you’ll see later in this section. In this section, as summarized in the following figure, you will learn about the rationale for international expansion and then how to analyze and evaluate markets for international expansion.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p01">Companies embark on an expansion strategy for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>To improve the cost-effectiveness of their operations</li>
                <li>To expand into new markets for new customers</li>
                <li>To follow global customers</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p02">For example, US chemical firm DuPont, Brazilian aerospace conglomerate Embraer, and Finnish mobile-phone maker Nokia are all investing in China to gain new customers. Schneider Logistics, in contrast, initially entered a new market, Germany, not to get new customers but to retain existing customers who needed a third-party logistics firm in Germany. Thus, Schneider followed its customers to Germany. Other companies, like microprocessor maker Intel, are building manufacturing facilities in China to take advantage of the less costly and increasingly sophisticated production capabilities. For example, Intel built a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, for $2.5 billion, whereas a similar state-of-the-art microprocessor plant in the United States can cost $5 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_006">“2011 Global R&amp;D Funding Forecast,” <em class="emphasis">R&amp;D Magazine</em>, December 2010, accessed January 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rdmag.com/tags/publications/global-r-and-d-funding-forecast">http://www.rdmag.com/tags/publications/global-r-and-d-funding-forecast</a>.</span> Intel has also built plants in Chengdu and Shanghai, China, and in other Asian countries (Vietnam and Malaysia) to take advantage of lower costs.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p01">As companies look for growth in new areas of the world, they typically prioritize which countries to enter. Because many markets look appealing due to their market size or low-cost production, it is important for firms to prioritize which countries to enter first and to evaluate each country’s relative merits. For example, some markets may be smaller in size, but their strategic complexity is lower, which may make them easier to enter and easier from an operations point of view. Sometimes there are even substantial regional differences within a given country, so careful investigation, research, and planning are important to do before entry.</p>

Market due diligence relies on using not just published research on the markets but also interviews with potential customers and industry experts. A systematic analysis needs to be done, using tools like PESTEL and CAGE, which will be described in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch10_s02#fwk-168388-ch10_s02">Section 8.2 "PESTEL, Globalization, and Importing"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch10_s04#fwk-168388-ch10_s04">Section 8.4 "CAGE Analysis"</a>, respectively. In this section, we begin with an overview.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_p02">Evaluating whether to enter a new market is like peeling an onion—there are many layers. For example, when evaluating whether to enter China, the advantage most people see immediately is its large market size. Further analysis shows that the majority of people in that market can’t afford US products, however. But even deeper analysis shows that while many Chinese are poor, the number of people who can afford consumer products is increasing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_007">Art Kleiner, “Getting China Right,” <em class="emphasis">Strategy and Business</em>, March 22, 2010, accessed January 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00026?pg=al">http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00026?pg=al</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s01_p01">The next part of due diligence is to understand the regional differences within the country and to not view the country as a monolith. For example, although companies are dazzled by China’s large market size, deeper analysis shows that 70 percent of the population lives in rural areas. This presents distribution challenges given China’s vast distances. In addition, consumers in different regions speak different dialects and have different tastes in food. Finally, the purchasing power of consumers varies in the different cities. City dwellers in Shanghai and Tianjin can afford higher prices than villagers in a western province.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s01_p02">Let’s look at a specific example. To achieve the dual goals of reducing operations costs and being closer to a new market of customers, for instance, numerous high-tech companies identify Malaysia as an attractive country to enter. Malaysia is a relatively inexpensive country and the population’s English skills are good, which makes it attractive both for finding local labor and for selling products. But even in a small country like Malaysia, there are regional differences. Companies may be tempted to set up operations in the capital city, Kuala Lumpur, but doing a thorough due diligence reveals that the costs in Kuala Lumpur are rising rapidly. If current trends continue, Kuala Lumpur will be as expensive as London in five years. Therefore, firms seeking primarily a lower-cost advantage would do better to locate to another city in Malaysia, such as Penang, which has many of the same advantages as Kuala Lumpur but does not have its rising costs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_008">Ajay Chamania, Heral Mehta, and Vikas Sehgal, “Five Factors for Finding the Right Site,” <em class="emphasis">Strategy and Business</em>, November 23, 2010, accessed May 17, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/10403?gko=e029a">http://www.strategy-business.com/article/10403?gko=e029a</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s02_p01">Entering a market means understanding the local consumers and what they look for when making a purchase decision. In some markets, price is an important issue. In other markets, such as Japan, consumers pay more attention to details—such as the quality of products and the design and presentation of the product or retail surroundings—than they do to price. The Japanese demand for perfect products means that firms entering Japan might have to spend a lot on quality management. Moreover, real-estate costs are high in Japan, as are freight costs such as fuel and highway charges. In addition, space is limited at retail stores and stockyards, which means that stores can’t hold much inventory, making replenishment of products a challenge. Therefore, when entering a new market, it’s vital for firms to perform full, detailed market research in order to understand the market conditions and take measures to account for them.</p>

Larger companies, like Intel, employ ethnographers and sociologists to spend months in emerging markets, living in local communities and seeking to understand the latent, unarticulated needs of local consumers. For example, Dr. Genevieve Bell, one of Intel’s anthropologists, traveled extensively across China, observing people in their homes to find out how they use technology and what they want from it. Intel then used her insights to shape its pricing strategies and its partnership plans for the Chinese consumer market.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_009">Navi Radjou, “R&amp;D 2.0: Fewer Engineers, More Anthropologists,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> (blog), June 10, 2009, accessed January 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/radjou/2009/06/rd-20-fewer-engineers-more-ant.html">http://blogs.hbr.org/radjou/2009/06/rd-20-fewer-engineers-more-ant.html</a>.</span></p>

For example, companies that help build infrastructure need to enter countries where the government or large companies have a lot of capital, because infrastructure projects are so expensive.

Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas learned this the hard way and ended up leaving some countries it had entered. The company’s president, Baldomero Falcones, explained, “When you decide whether or not to invest, one factor to take into account is the rule of law.

                <h2 class="title editable block">Steps and Missteps in International Expansion</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s06_p01">Let’s look at an example of the steps—as well as the missteps—in international expansion. American retailers entered the Chilean market in the mid- to late 1990s. They chose Chile as the market to enter because of the country’s strong economy, the advanced level of the Chilean retail sector, and the free trade agreements signed by Chile. From that standpoint, their due diligence was accurate, but it didn’t go far enough, as we’ll see.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s06_p02">Retailer JCPenney entered Chile in 1995, opening two stores. French retailer Carrefour also entered Chile, in 1998. Neither company entered through an alliance with a local retailer. Both companies were forced to close their Chilean operations due to the losses they were incurring. Analysis by the Aldolfo Ibáñez University in Chile explained the reasons behind the failures: the managers of these companies were not able to connect with the local market, nor did they understand the variables that affected their businesses in Chile.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn10_018">“The Globalization of Chilean Retailing,” <em class="emphasis">Knowledge@Wharton</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed January 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.universia.net/index.cfm?fa=viewfeature&amp;id=1450&amp;language=english">http://www.wharton.universia.net/index.cfm?fa=viewfeature&amp;id=1450&amp;language=english</a>.</span> Specifically, the Chilean retailing market was advanced, but it was also very competitive. The new entrants (JCPenney and Carrefour) didn’t realize that the existing major local retailers had their own banks and offered banking services at their retail stores, which was a major reason for their profitability. The outsiders assumed that profitability in this sector was based solely on retail sales. They missed the importance of the bank ties. Another typical mistake that companies make is to assume that a new market has no competition just because the company’s traditional competitors aren’t in that market.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s06_p03">Now let’s continue with the example and watch native Chilean retailers enter a market new to them: Peru.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s06_p04">The Chilean retailers were successful in their own markets but wanted to expand beyond their borders in order to get new customers in new markets. The Chilean retailers chose to enter Peru, which had the same language.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch10_s01_s01_s03_s06_p05">The Peruvian retailing market was not advanced, and it did not offer credit to customers. The Chileans entered the market through partnership with local Peruvian firms, and they introduced the concept of credit cards, which was an innovation in the poorly developed Peruvian market. Entering through a domestic partner helped the Chileans because it eliminated hostility and made the investment process easier.
