Communications and other technologies are flattening the world in regard to innovation, enabling innovation activities to be located anywhere, while the absence of legal property-rights protections in some areas work against this flattener. <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch13_s04#fwk-168388-ch13_s04">Section 13.4 "Increasing Speed and Effectiveness of International Innovation"</a> discusses the activities associated with managing innovation and running international R&amp;D to increase the speed and effectivness with which a firm can innovate.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s00_p01">For most companies, the traditional route to global business is through the export of the products they have developed and manufactured for their home markets. But most of the products sold in developed countries are much too expensive for emerging markets, where most of the people make less than $1,500 per year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_001">“Sachet Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Trend Watching</em>, accessed May 16, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://trendwatching.com/trends/sachet_marketing.htm">http://trendwatching.com/trends/sachet_marketing.htm</a>.</span> Simply exporting products designed for the United States, Western Europe, or Japan doesn’t work well. Nor does simply lowering the price of products, because lower prices mean both lower margins and increased risks of cannibalizing the profits of higher-priced brands.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s00_p02">Moreover, emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (also collectively known as the BRIC countries), don’t have the same needs or capabilities as those found in developed economies. For instance, disposable income levels are relatively low, the availability of basic utilities like water or electricity can be varied, and transportation and transportation infrastructure can be nonexistent. While these emerging economies are attractive by virtue of their massive size, their different needs and capabilities pose unique challenges that are often overcome only through corporate innovation. Let’s look at a case in point—Unilever in Brazil.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s00_p03">Among consumer packaged-goods (CPG) companies, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) often trade punches for customers in the world’s emerging markets. Take their efforts in trying to market powdered laundry detergent (sometimes referred to as “washing powders”) to the tens of millions of poorer consumers in Brazil. A decade ago, Unilever and P&amp;G held significantly different market shares than they do today. Unilever held an 81 percent market share in the powered detergent sector while P&amp;G was a late entrant in the market and was a distant second behind Unilever. P&amp;G, however, was known for its strong R&amp;D unit and extensive marketing experience worldwide; thus it posed a potential threat to Unilever.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_002">Pierre Chandon, “Unilever in Brazil: Marketing Strategies for Low-Income Countries,” November 28, 2006, accessed December 19, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://estrategiasynegocios.wordpress.com/2006/11/28/case-study-unilever-in-brazil-marketing-strategies-for-low-income-countries">http://estrategiasynegocios.wordpress.com/2006/11/28/case-study-unilever-in-brazil-marketing-strategies-for-low-income-countries</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s00_p04">Laercio Cardoso, head of Unilever’s Home Care division in Brazil, knew he had to take action to respond to P&amp;G’s imminent threat. The solution, as he saw it, was to develop a product targeting the lower end of the market. But Cardoso faced opposition from his own colleagues at Unilever, because they ascribed Unilever’s prior success to its premium-quality products. They also argued that any successful move into the low-end market would have to draw demand from Brazil’s low-income consumers living in its vast <em class="emphasis">favelas</em> (slums). Over the years, both in Brazil and elsewhere, Unilever had learned that the attitudes and behaviors of this segment of consumers were very different from what Unilever was used to in the more high-end markets.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s00_p05">For example, Unilever knew that low-end consumers in Brazil didn’t own washing machines. Instead, mothers washed the family’s clothing by hand in the river. Regardless of whether the family lived in a city or rural area, the river was the place where mothers gathered to wash the clothes. What’s more, the women shopped at local mom-and-pop stores, not big central shopping centers. To succeed in this new market, therefore, Unilever would have to design a soap that was effective for washing clothes by hand and that could be easily transported to the local mom-and-pop shops.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s00_p06">Drawing on its experience in India, Unilever launched Ala, a brand of detergent created specifically to meet the needs of low-income consumers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_003">“Sachet Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Trend Watching</em>, accessed May 16, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://trendwatching.com/trends/SACHET_MARKETING.htm">http://trendwatching.com/trends/SACHET_MARKETING.htm</a>.</span> The product is designed to work well for laundry washed by hand in river water. It’s affordable and effective—and it is sold in small sizes to make it easy to transport and stock in a local store. The technique of small-portion packaging is called “sachet marketing,” originating from powered soaps and shampoos sold in sachets in India for two to four cents each.</p>

Companies undertake R&amp;D in order to develop new products, services, or procedures that will help them grow and expand their operations. Corporate R&amp;D began in the United States with Thomas Edison and the Edison General Electric Company he founded in 1890 (which is today’s GE).

Edison’s 1,093 patents had less to do with individual genius and more to do with management genius: creating and managing an R&amp;D lab that could efficiently and effectively crank out new inventions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s01_p01">From Edison’s lab onward, companies learned that a systematic approach to research could provide big competitive advantages. Companies could not only invent new products, but they could also turn those inventions into innovations that launched whole new industries. For example, the radio, wireless communications, and television industry grew out of early-twentieth-century research by General Electric and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T, which founded Bell Labs).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s01_p02">The heyday of American R&amp;D labs came in the 1950s and early 1960s, with corporate institutions like Bell Labs, RCA labs, IBM’s research centers, and government institutions such as NASA and DARPA. These labs funded both basic and applied research, giving birth to the transistor, long-distance TV transmission, photovoltaic solar cells, the UNIX operating system, and cellular telephony, each of which led to the creation of not just hundreds of products but whole industries and millions of jobs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_009">Adrian Slywotzky, “How Science Can Create Millions of New Jobs,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, September 7, 2009, accessed May 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145036678131.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145036678131.htm</a>.</span> DARPA’s creation of the Internet (known at its inception as ARPAnet) and Xerox PARC’s Ethernet and graphical-user interface (GUI) laid the foundations for the PC revolution.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_010">Adrian Slywotzky, “How Science Can Create Millions of New Jobs,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, September 7, 2009, accessed May 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145036678131.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145036678131.htm</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s01_p03">Companies invest in R&amp;D to gain a pipeline of new products. For a high-tech company like Apple, it means coming up with new types of products (e.g., the iPad) as well as newer and better versions of its existing computers and iPhones. For a pharmaceutical company, it means coming out with new drugs to treat diseases. Different parts of the world have different diseases or different forms of known diseases. For example, diabetes in China has a different molecular structure than diabetes elsewhere in the world, and pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly’s new R&amp;D center in Shanghai will focus on this disease variant.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_011">“2011 Global R&amp;D Funding Forecast,” <em class="emphasis">R&amp;D Magazine</em>, December 2010, accessed February 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.battelle.org/aboutus/rd/2011.pdf">http://www.battelle.org/aboutus/rd/2011.pdf</a>.</span> Even companies that sell only services benefit from innovation and developing new services. For example, MasterCard Global Service started providing customers with emergency cash advances, directions to nearby ATMs, and emergency card replacements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_012">Lance Bettencourt, <em class="emphasis">Service Innovation</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010), 99.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s01_p04">Innovation also includes new product and service combinations. For example, heavy-equipment manufacturer John Deere created a product and service combination by equipping a GPS into one of its tractors. The GPS keeps the tractor on a parallel path, even under hands-free operation, and keeps the tractor with only a two-centimeter overlap of those parallel lines. This innovation helps a farmer increase the yield of the field and complete passes over the field in the tractor more quickly. The innovation also helps reduce fuel, seed, and chemical costs because there is little overlap and waste of the successive parallel passes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_013">Lance Bettencourt, <em class="emphasis">Service Innovation</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010), 110.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of Government</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s02_p01">Governments have played a large role in the inception of R&amp;D, mainly to fund research for military applications for war efforts. Today, governments still play a big role in innovation because of their ability to fund R&amp;D. A government can fund R&amp;D directly, by offering grants to universities and research centers or by offering contracts to corporations for performing research in a specific area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s02_p02">Governments can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in R&amp;D. Countries vary in the tax incentives that they give to corporations that invest in R&amp;D. By giving corporations a tax credit when they invest in R&amp;D, governments encourage corporations to invest in R&amp;D in their countries. For example, Australia gave a 125 percent tax deduction for R&amp;D expenses. The Australian government’s website noted, “It’s little surprise then, that many companies from around the world are choosing to locate their R&amp;D facilities in Australia.” The government also pointed out that “50 percent of the most innovative companies in Australia are foreign-based.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_016">Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century (U.S.), Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (U.S.), <em class="emphasis">Rising Above the Gathering Storm</em> (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2007), 195.</span></p>

China is doing this in a big way, and it is thus influencing the course of many companies around the world. Since 2000, China has had a policy in place “to encourage tech transfer from abroad and to force foreign companies to transfer their R&amp;D operations to China in exchange for access to China’s large volume markets,” reported <em class="emphasis">R&amp;D Magazine</em> in its 2010 review of global R&amp;D.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_017">“2011 Global R&amp;D Funding Forecast,” <em class="emphasis">R&amp;D Magazine</em>, December 2010, accessed February 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.battelle.org/aboutus/rd/2011.pdf">http://www.battelle.org/aboutus/rd/2011.pdf</a>.</span> For example, any automobile manufacturer that wants to sell cars in China must enter into a partnership with a Chinese company. As a result, General Motors (GM), Daimler, Hyundai, Volkswagen (VW), and Toyota have all formed joint ventures with Chinese companies. General Motors and Volkswagen, for example, have both formed joint ventures with the Chinese company Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), even though SAIC also sells cars under its own brand.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_018">Brian Dumaine, “China Charges into Electric Cars,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, November 1, 2010, 140.</span> The Chinese government made another strategic decision influencing innovation in the automobile industry.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s01_s02_p04">Another role of government is to set high targets that require innovation. In the 1960s, the US Apollo space program launched by President John F. Kennedy inspired US corporations to work toward putting a man on the moon. The government’s investments in the Apollo program sped up the development of computer and communications technology and also led to innovations in fuel cells, water purification, freeze-drying food, and digital image processing now used in medical products for CAT scans and MRIs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_022">Adrian Slywotzky, “How Science Can Create Millions of New Jobs,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, September 7, 2009, accessed May 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145036678131.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145036678131.htm</a>.</span> Today, government policies coming from the European Union mandate ambitious environmental targets, such as carbon-neutral fuels and energy, which are driving global R&amp;D to achieve environmental goals the way the Apollo program drove R&amp;D in the 1960s.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_023">Martin Grueber and Tim Studt, “A Battelle Perspective on Investing in International R&amp;D,” <em class="emphasis">R&amp;D Magazine</em>, December 22, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rdmag.com/Featured-Articles/2009/12/Global-Funding-Forecast-A-Battelle-Perspective-International-R-D">http://www.rdmag.com/Featured-Articles/2009/12/Global-Funding-Forecast-A-Battelle-Perspective-International-R-D</a>.</span></p>

Governments in other countries, however, continue to invest. New government-corporate partnerships are developing around the world. IBM, which for years closely guarded its R&amp;D labs (even IBM employees were required to have special badges to enter the R&amp;D area), is now setting up “collaboratories” around the world. These collaboratories are partnerships between IBM researchers and outside experts from government, universities, and even other companies. “The world is our lab now,” says John E.

An example is IBM’s research partnership with the state-funded Swiss university ETH Zurich. The two are building a $70 million semiconductor lab for nanotech research with the goal of identifying a replacement for the current semiconductor-switch technology.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_025">Steve Hamm, “How Big Blue Is Forging Cutting-Edge Partnerships around the World,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, August 27, 2009, accessed January 2, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/09_36/b4145040683083.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/09_36/b4145040683083.htm</a>.</span> Such a breakthrough could harken the creation of a whole new industry.</p>

It has been generally accepted that it’s desirable to encourage R&amp;D for reasons of economic growth as well as national security. This has resulted in massive support from public funds for many sorts of laboratories. Governments influence R&amp;D not only by providing direct funding but also by providing tax incentives to companies that invest in R&amp;D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p01">For companies to gain financial benefits from investing in research and coming up with new inventions, there must be legal protection for those inventions. The system of law related to R&amp;D and innovation is referred to as intellectual property rights. Different countries vary in the extent to which they protect intellectual property and enforce intellectual property regulations. The presence of strong, enforceable, consistent property rights serves to make the world flatter. However, as long as significant differences in property rights exist around the globe, the world will be far from flat with respect to innovation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Intellectual property (IP)</a><span class="glossdef">Creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce.</span></span> refers to creations of the mind—inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_026">“What Is Intellectual Property?,” World Intellectual Property Organization, 2003, accessed March 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/450/wipo_pub_450.pdf">http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/450/wipo_pub_450.pdf</a>.</span> The term <em class="emphasis">property</em> connotes ownership that’s exclusive, but the owners have the right to license or sell their IP. Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intellectual property rights (IPR)</a><span class="glossdef">The exclusive rights granted to owners for their intangible assets under intellectual property law.</span></span>—to the discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs they create.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p03">Let’s look at the ways companies protect their IP and profit from it. The simplest way for a company to protect its intellectual property is to never reveal it—to create what is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade secret</a><span class="glossdef">Any confidential business information which provides an enterprise with a competitive edge.</span></span>. This is how Coca-Cola protects the formula for its hugely popular soda. If the secret were discovered or revealed through nefarious intent, then trade secret law would allow punishment of the perpetrator, including criminal prosecution. But if a company somehow developed the same formula on its own, Coca-Cola could do nothing to stop them. Therefore, companies opt for other IP protection—namely, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">patents</a><span class="glossdef">Exclusive right granted for an invention, whether a product or a process, which must be industrially applicable (useful), be new (novel), and exhibit a sufficient “inventive step” (be nonobvious).</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">copyrights</a><span class="glossdef">The body of laws that grants authors, artists, and other creators protection for their literary and artistic creations, which are generally referred to as “works.”</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p04">The most common way to protect an industrial discovery or invention is to patent it. A patent is an inventor’s exclusive right granted by the government for an invention, whether a product or a process, that is industrially applicable (i.e., useful) or new (i.e., novel) or exhibits a sufficient “inventive step” (i.e., be nonobvious) To get a patent, the company must reveal the details of the invention. The rationale for revealing the invention details is so that others can build on the invention and thus promote further innovation. By revealing the invention, companies obtain legal protection and the right to exclusive sales of the invention (or the right to license or sell its use to others). The patent gives the patent owner a monopoly on the invention for a specific number of years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p05">Patents can be granted within a single country or internationally. Christian Hahner, head of Intellectual Property &amp; Technology Management at Daimler, said, “Attaining international patent protection is an expensive undertaking. If we believe it’s important for our business to actively defend our patent in court in order to prevent unauthorized copies or imitations, then we have to nationalize the patent, which makes it valid in other countries.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_027">Peter Thomas, “Patents Are the Future of Innovation Management,” <em class="emphasis">Technicity</em>, 2010, accessed February 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner">http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner</a>.</span> A patent prohibits other people from selling the identical product built in the same way as the accepted patent. Patents give the owner the right to defend the invention in court, but they don’t automatically mean that the owner will win the court case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s02_s01_p06">“When I make an innovation public in Germany by initially registering a patent, I’m actually defining the state of the art. It then becomes impossible for anyone else in the world to patent that innovation,” Hahner said. “The publication of the patent also creates conditions that enable the worldwide utilization of innovations with great value to society—like those related to vehicle safety, for example.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_028">Peter Thomas, “Patents Are the Future of Innovation Management.” <em class="emphasis">Technicity</em>, 2010, accessed February 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner">http://www.daimler-technicity.de/en/christianhahner</a>.</span> That is, by disclosing the invention publicly, the inventor gets legal protection from outright copying of the invention, but society also benefits because others learn about the invention and can try to devise a different, original way to achieve the same outcome. Because of this fear of copying, some companies, such as Microsoft, choose not to patent some of their products. For example, Microsoft does not have a patent on its Windows software because doing so would force it to reveal its source code, which Microsoft does not want to do.</p>

In turn, other companies actively seek patents that they can purchase because they want to speed up their own R&amp;D efforts.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s03_s01_p01">The flattening world is putting more pressure on corporate research and development (R&amp;D) to come up with new products and services in less time and at lower cost. As a result, new models for how a company should organize its R&amp;D activities have emerged. The traditional model of having one central R&amp;D center located in the United States is being replaced by having a network of smaller R&amp;D centers located in various parts of the world. The reasons for this dispersion of R&amp;D activities are to tap talent around the world, to lower costs, and to be better able to develop new products and services tailored to new country markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s03_s01_p02">When designing the R&amp;D network, companies need to make sure that all centers use the same communication and information systems platform so that team members can communicate regardless of where they are.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s01_p01">We typically think of new products and services as the innovation output of investments in research and development (R&amp;D). However, a significant amount of innovation yields no new products or services, not because of R&amp;D failure, but because the innovations are not related to a company’s core processes. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">process innovation</a><span class="glossdef">Implementing a new or significantly improved process.</span></span> is an innovation in the way a company does any process, such as taking a customer order. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">process</a><span class="glossdef">A series of linked activities (steps, tasks, or subprocesses) that produce an intended result.</span></span> is defined as “a specific ordering of work activities across time and place, with a beginning and end, and clearly identified inputs and outputs.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_052">Thomas Davenport, <em class="emphasis">Process Innovation</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 1993), 5.</span> Processes can be simple activities (e.g., filling out a travel expense report), longer processes (e.g., issuing an insurance policy), or a broad set of activities (e.g., inventory management and distributions). The broader the process, the more impact innovating that process will have. For example, UPS made a process change when designing the routes its drivers follow when making deliveries. The company’s routes give preference to making right turns rather than left turns whenever possible. The reason is that right turns are easier, faster, and safer—and they save fuel compared to left turns. This “right turn” process innovation doesn’t involve the customer, but it helps UPS operate more efficiently.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Open Innovation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s02_p01">Among the latest developments in corporate innovation is the concept of open innovation. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Open innovation</a><span class="glossdef">Generating new business ideas through input from employees beyond a company’s R&amp;D department and even going outside the firm to enlist contributions from experts, customers, suppliers, and competitors.</span></span> is the intentional leveraging of the research, ideas, or technologies of outsiders—that is, people or companies that are not part of the corporate entity—rather than relying solely on innovations that are generated from inside the company. Open innovation takes innovation beyond a company’s R&amp;D lab and lets customers and partners participate in the creation of new product and services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s02_p02">Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) embarked on open innovation in 2001 with its Connect + Develop program. For example, the innovation of printing text or images on Pringles chips came about through P&amp;G partnering with a professor in Italy who ran a small bakery and had invented a technology that used ink-jet techniques to print pictures on pastries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_053">Stefan Lindegaard, <em class="emphasis">The Open Innovation Revolution</em> (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010), 9.</span> P&amp;G adopted the technology to work with potato chips and launched Pringles Prints (chips with images and text printed on them) at a fraction of the cost and time it would have taken to research and develop the technology internally. Since adopting open innovation 2001, P&amp;G’s innovation success rate has doubled, while its costs have decreased.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_054">Larry Huston and Nabil Sakkab, “Connect and Develop,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 84, no. 3 (March 2006), accessed January 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/2006/03/connect-and-develop/ar/1">http://hbr.org/2006/03/connect-and-develop/ar/1</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s02_p03">Another example of open innovation is from Kraft Foods. When Irene Rosenfeld took over as CEO of Kraft Foods, she saw an anemic innovation pipeline. The company had 2,000 corporate R&amp;D staff—scientists, engineers and chemists—but new products weren’t flowing rapidly enough.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_055">Andrea Meyer, “Kraft: The ‘$40 Billion Start-Up’ Spurs Innovation,” <em class="emphasis">Working Knowledge</em> (blog), October 7, 2009, accessed February 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://workingknowledge.com/blog/?p=878">http://workingknowledge.com/blog/?p=878</a>.</span> To solve the problem, she encouraged Kraft managers to reach out beyond corporate R&amp;D and enlist the help of employees across the whole company, as well as suppliers and partners, to spur innovation. For example, Kraft runs an online “Innovate with Kraft” program whereby anyone can submit product ideas. The idea for Kraft’s Bagel-fuls (frozen bagels prefilled with Philadelphia Cream Cheese), for instance, came unsolicited from a bagel supplier. The idea was a win-win for both companies: it solved some technical challenges that Kraft had faced in delivering a bagel-and-cheese combo, and it boosted the revenue of the bagel supplier.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Innovation Contests</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s03_p01">One method by which a company can manage and run open innovation is to use a contest or “challenge” method. In the contest method, the company poses a challenge, such as a way “to drop large amounts Humanitarian food and water packages from an aircraft into populated areas such that there is no danger of falling objects (i.e., nonfood items) causing harm to those on the ground” and offers a financial reward to the person, company, or team that solves the problem first.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_056">“Humanitarian Air Drop Challenge,” <em class="emphasis">InnoCentive</em>, March 2, 2011, accessed March 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://gw.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/overview/9932741">https://gw.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/overview/9932741</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s03_p02">Companies can run their own open innovation contests, or they can use a third-party provider like InnoCentive (which originated inside Eli Lilly and Company and was spun off as a separate company in 2005). InnoCentive runs contests via the web and has a community of more than 180,000 engineers, scientists, inventors, business professionals, and research organizations in 175 countries who regularly participate in its contests. Financial prizes as high as $1 million are awarded for the best solutions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s03_p03">The advantages of the open innovation contest approach include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>Reduced cost of R&amp;D because, rather than funding R&amp;D projects that may fail, the contest approach pays the financial reward only after the solution is found. If no viable solution is found, the company does not pay the financial reward.</li>
            <li>Faster product development time because multiple teams work on the project at the same time, with an incentive to be the first to develop a viable solution and thus win the prize.</li>
            <li>Access to experts from around the world. The experts do not have to be employed by the firm but can still contribute an idea or solution. This gives a firm access to experts and talent which it couldn’t afford to employ full time.</li>
            <li>Bigger breakthroughs because experts in a different field can make an unusual connection. For example, InnoCentive’s challenge to find a biomarker for ALS disease received a solution proposed by a dermatologist—someone completely outside the ALS research field but who had an idea for a low-cost testing method.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s03_p04">The contest method has had such success that now the US government also uses this approach to reward innovative solutions.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Role of Intrapreneurship in Corporate Innovation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s04_p01">Large multinationals that have R&amp;D centers also look for other ways to encourage innovation and new ideas. One effective way to stimulate innovation is to devise ways for intrapreneurs to contribute their ideas. Let’s look at how one multinational, Shell, does this. Despite spending over $1 billion annually on R&amp;D, Shell also runs a small program called GameChanger to foster radically innovative ideas. Started in 2006, GameChanger is a program to which any Shell employee anywhere in the world can contribute an idea for a product, project, or service. The program is open to nonemployees as well, making it an example of open innovation. Interestingly, about 70 percent of the proposed projects include at least one person who is not a Shell employee. (The nonemployee is typically someone associated with a university.)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_057">“Boston Consulting Group, Simulation Advantage,” Boston Consulting Group, accessed February 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bcg.com/documents/file57197.pdf">http://www.bcg.com/documents/file57197.pdf</a>.</span> Under the GameChanger program, a team of experts evaluates all the submitted ideas.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s05_p01">The precursor to open innovation was the concept of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">user-led innovation</a><span class="glossdef">Innovation by consumers and end users, who are using (or want to use) the product in new ways beyond what the company originally intended.</span></span>, first identified by MIT professor Eric von Hippel. Von Hippel noticed that many breakthrough innovations don’t come out of a company’s lab but rather from the lead users of the company’s products. In some cases, the lead users even precede a company. For example, von Hippel says that skateboards were the invention of people who took their roller skates and hammered a piece of board between them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_061">Haydn Shaughnessy, “Eric Von Hippel on Innovation,” <em class="emphasis">Innovation Management</em>, February 21, 2011, accessed February 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2011/02/21/eric-von-hippel-on-innovation/?utm_source=Subscribers+InnovationManagement.se&amp;utm_campaign=2780c497a9-Five+Steps+to+Profitable+Innovation&amp;utm_medium=email">http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2011/02/21/eric-von-hippel-on-innovation/?utm_source=Subscribers+InnovationManagement.se&amp;utm_campaign= 2780c497a9-Five+Steps+to+Profitable+Innovation&amp;utm_medium=email</a>.</span> Companies later saw the popularity of the invention and took over the refinement and manufacture of skateboards. Similarly, von Hippel says, M-Pesa did not invent mobile banking. Rather, it saw people in Africa buying minutes for their cell phones and then transferring those minutes to relatives in lieu of money. M-Pesa made the process systematic so that money could be transferred between people who didn’t already have a relationship with each other—namely, for business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_062">Haydn Shaughnessy, “Eric Von Hippel on Innovation,” <em class="emphasis">Innovation Management</em>, February 21, 2011, accessed February 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2011/02/21/eric-von-hippel-on-innovation/?utm_source=Subscribers+InnovationManagement.se&amp;utm_campaign=2780c497a9-Five+Steps+to+Profitable+Innovation&amp;utm_medium=email">http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2011/02/21/eric-von-hippel-on-innovation/?utm_source=Subscribers+InnovationManagement.se&amp;utm_campaign= 2780c497a9-Five+Steps+to+Profitable+Innovation&amp;utm_medium=email</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Networks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s06_p01">One of the features common to both open innovation and user-led innovation is the important and integral role played by social networks. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social network</a><span class="glossdef">A social structure made of nodes (which are generally individuals or organizations) that are connected by ties; a set of relationships among people.</span></span> is a social structure made of nodes (which are generally individuals or organizations) that are connected by ties. In other words, it’s a set of relationships among people. Your social network is the structure of personal and professional relationships you have with others. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social capital</a><span class="glossdef">The resources—such as ideas, information, money, and trust—that one is able to access through one’s social network.</span></span>, in turn, is the resources—such as ideas, information, money, and trust—that you’re able to access and influence through your social network. While social networks and social capital can be associated with many things, they’re particularly important sources of innovation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s06_p02">In a typical company, innovation relies on a handpicked team leading an innovation project. The trouble is that these teams often have no good way of tapping the expertise of the whole company. They tend to call on the small circle of colleagues they know or on the acknowledged experts in an established field. But such teams often have a hard time identifying people they don’t already know but who might have knowledge relevant to the problem at hand. As a result, potential good ideas are lost or hidden—they remain inside the heads of unknown employees. That’s where social software tools come in handy. With social software tools, a company can start a discussion on a topic and employees who know about the topic self-identify by posting ideas, refining the ideas of others, and voting on ideas. That is, employees don’t need to be “found” by the innovation team. They can post ideas and thus self-identify and demonstrate their knowledge. For example, a company could start a discussion like “Can we develop a new water-filtration product?” People from market research might identify the top-selling filtration products. Someone from human resources who recently bought a water-filtration system for her family might contribute her own insights gathered from what blogs and outside websites were saying about all the competing products (e.g., “Brand B is bad because it’s difficult to install”). Other employees might point out the engineering deficits of a proposed technology, such as that a potential filter material is too expensive for consumer water filters. Another person might have good suggestions for how to solve the cost problem (e.g., to coat the expensive filter ingredient on a cheaper material). The point is that with the help of social networking tools, these contributions can come from any employee, not just the handpicked team members and their inner circle.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_063">Andrea Meyer, “Using Social Media to Improve Corporate Innovation,” <em class="emphasis">Working Knowledge</em> (blog), accessed March 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://workingknowledge.com/blog/?p=578">http://workingknowledge.com/blog/?p=578</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s04_s06_p03">Software tools that promote social networking are even more important when companies expand internationally, because it will be hard for innovation teams to personally know all the employees who could contribute innovative ideas. With enterprise-wide social networking tools, these employees can self-identify.</p>

This shift in view, Karnani argues, is the way to alleviate poverty by raising the incomes of the poor.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s05_s01_p03">In Prahalad and Hart’s view, companies that understand the potential for commercial consumption at the BOP can open a new, potentially lucrative market that benefits the business as well as BOP consumers. By innovating to meet the needs of BOP customers, a company treats them with dignity and respect that previously was afforded only to the wealthy, Prahalad and Hart say.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Twelve Principles of BOP Innovation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s05_s02_p01">Addressing the bottom of the pyramid requires a fresh managerial mind-set, summarized below in Prahalad’s “12 Principles of BOP Innovation”—which are innovations themselves.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_066">C. K. Prahalad, <em class="emphasis">The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Wharton School Publishing, 2004), 25–27.</span> In developed markets, Prahalad suggests that one may take the availability of electricity, telephones, credit, refrigeration, and other such amenities for granted. At the BOP, the infrastructure is much spottier and more hostile. Consumers may have to cope with frequent electric-power blackouts and brownouts. Credit may be extremely costly. Refrigeration may be unavailable. Products marketed to the bottom of the pyramid must be able to withstand such an environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s05_s02_p02">Below are Prahalad’s “12 Principles of BOP Innovation,” along with examples of each.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch13_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Focus on value and on delivering performance for the price.</strong> The BOP consumer isn’t interested merely in cheap prices but in getting the greatest possible performance for the price paid. It’s extraordinary how low a price can be and still be highly profitable, if the seller is organized to deliver value. For example, doctors at India’s Aravind Eye Care System, the world’s largest eye-care business, perform hundreds of thousands of cataract surgeries each year. The prices range from $50 to $300 per surgery, including the hospital stay. Aravind is quite profitable, although 60 percent of its patients pay nothing.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Innovate.</strong> Old technologies can’t solve the problems of BOP consumers, and products aimed at the BOP market can’t simply be watered-down versions of developed-world products. Instead, products must be rethought to bring radically lower cost while at the same time having features that meet the BOP’s highest needs. For example, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), a Unilever subsidiary, developed a new molecular encapsulation technology to prevent iodized salt from losing its iodine before consumption. To test the efficacy of the technology, the researchers used radioactive tracing techniques pioneered by the Indian Atomic Energy Commission.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make the solution scalable.</strong> When delivering high performance at affordable prices, profits must be generated through volume sales. The product itself must be low cost, but with four billion to five billion BOP customers across the world, scaling the operation is what will make the venture sustainable. Solutions should be scalable across borders.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Aim to conserve resources.</strong> BOP consumers cannot afford to waste resources. Per capita water consumption in the United States is almost 2,000 cubic meters per year, compared to less than 500 in China and less than 700 in India. The developed world’s high standard of living is a water- and waste-intensive lifestyle. Innovations should emphasize conserving resources, recycling materials, and eliminating waste. Creating products for five billion people means designing the products in ways that can be environmentally sustainable. China’s focus on electric cars rather than gasoline-powered cars reflects the reality that it’s unlikely China could obtain the oil it would need for that many cars and that its extremely polluted cities could handle the additional exhaust fumes.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Identify functionality.</strong> BOP customers likely require different functionality than high-end consumers. For example, prosthetic legs developed for India’s BOP consumers needed to meet some special requirements: consumers needed to be able to squat, sit cross-legged, and walk on rough ground. Dr. Pramod Karan Sethi and Ram Chandra developed the Jaipur Foot prosthetic for this purpose. The charity Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, which is based in Jaipur, India, made them available for less than $30.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn13_067">Tim McGirk, “The $28 Foot,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, accessed May 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/reports/heroes/foot.html">http://www.time.com/time/reports/heroes/foot.html</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Think in terms of process innovations.</strong> One way to bring costs down dramatically is to standardize processes. That’s how Aravind is able to bring down the costs of cataract surgery so dramatically. Aravind made the process highly standardized and trained young village women to prepare patients and handle postoperative care. Thus doctors focus exclusively on surgery and perform only cataract surgery—nothing else. This focused process lets one doctor and two technicians perform fifty surgeries per day.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reduce the skills required to do the job.</strong> Design products and services suitable to people without skills. Voxiva, a Peruvian start-up, developed a system enabling health-care workers to diagnose illnesses such as smallpox by comparing a patient’s lesions to a picture of a similar lesion. With this simplified diagnostic process, health-care workers don’t require great skills to know when to call a doctor.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Educate consumers in the use of products.</strong> This may require collaborating with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), governments, and others. HUL launched a program in some of India’s village schools to promote the washing of hands with soap as a way to prevent the childhood diarrhea that kills two million children per year. HUL educated the children, who in turn educated their parents.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Design products and services to operate in very tough infrastructure environments.</strong> For example, when Indian conglomerate ITC built a network connecting Indian villages, it had to provide personal computers that could handle wide voltage fluctuations. ITC included surge suppressors and solar panels to give the system adequate, reliable electricity.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make the interface simple and the learning curve short.</strong> In Mexico, the chain retailer Elektra uses automated teller machines (ATMs) with a fingerprint identification system so BOP consumers don’t have to remember lengthy identification codes.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Innovate in distribution.</strong> Avon has built a Brazilian direct-sales business that delivers revenues of $1.7 billion annually.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Challenge assumptions.</strong> The Jaipur Foot and Aravind Eye Care System hospitals defy conventional wisdom about how (and at what price) it’s possible to deliver health care to the poor.</li>

            <li>In 1998, Nike launched the World Shoe Project, which is a line of footwear targeted and designed exclusively for emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. By January 2001, Tom Hartge and his team at Nike had sold only 404,520 pairs of World Shoes in China.
