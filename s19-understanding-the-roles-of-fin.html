    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_p01">In this chapter, you’ll learn the principles and techniques of global finance and accounting. In the opening case study, you’ll see the increased role that governments are playing in the business finance arena. In a flat world, access to capital (i.e., part of the finance function) is uniform across countries, as are accounting standards. However, access to capital varies significantly across countries and between small and large firms. Accounting standards also vary, though these differences are decreasing.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p01">Among the many changes taking place in the international business landscape, numerous leading management consultants predict that government will play an increasingly active role. Governments will no longer simply be an external regulator but will be a direct participant in particular strategic choices and actions. The <em class="emphasis">new normal</em>, in terms of government involvement in business, is one in which government’s hand in strategy and strategy execution will be highly visible and significant. Part of this governmental activism is a result of the growing scale and reach of global firms. For instance, even before the global financial meltdown in 2009, McKinsey &amp; Company consultancy noted the following:</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p02">As businesses expand their global reach, and as the economic demands on the environment intensify, the level of societal suspicion about big business is likely to increase. The tenets of current global business ideology—for example, shareholder value, free trade, intellectual-property rights, and profit repatriation—are not understood, let alone accepted, in many parts of the world. Scandals and environmental mishaps seem as inevitable as the likelihood that these incidents will be subsequently blown out of proportion, thereby fueling resentment and creating a political and regulatory backlash. This trend is not just of the past 5 years but of the past 250 years. The increasing pace and extent of global business, and the emergence of truly giant global corporations, will exacerbate the pressures over the next 10 years.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_001">Ian Davis and Elizabeth Stephenson, “Ten Trends to Watch in 2006,” <em class="emphasis">McKinsey Quarterly</em>, January 2006, accessed July 24, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Ten_trends_to_watch_in_2006_1734">https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Ten_trends_to_watch_in_2006_1734</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p03">Unfortunately for big (and small) business, the apparent systematic risk, managerial excesses, and imprudence that led to the global financial meltdown in 2008 and 2009 have only exacerbated the interest of government in business matters.

Its mining products are used for unearthing coal, gold, iron ore, oil sands, and other raw materials. The company sells products to customers worldwide, from large companies to small ones to quasi-governmental agencies operating largely in South America, Australia, Canada, China, India, South Africa, and the United States. Even though Bucyrus is a US-based company, international sales account for more than 70 percent of its revenues.</p>

        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p05">Like many successful multinationals, much of Bucyrus’s new work takes place in emerging markets where the growth and need is greatest. For instance, Bucyrus struck a deal in which its mining shovels would be used to dig coal to fire a giant, new power plant being built by Reliance Industries in India. Reliance, with nearly 25,000 employees, is India’s largest private-sector conglomerate, with business interests in energy, retailing, chemicals, textiles, and communications.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_004">“10 Years Highlight: Financial Highlights,” Reliance Industries Limited, accessed July 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ril.com/html/investor/10_yearshighlight.html">http://www.ril.com/html/investor/10_yearshighlight.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p06">Although Bucyrus and Reliance had agreed on the deal, the involvement of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) as a loan guarantor complicated things. Ex-Im Bank is the principal government agency responsible for aiding the export of American goods and services—thereby creating and sustaining US jobs—through a variety of loan, guarantee, and insurance programs. Although supporting US exports is its primary mission, the bank was sued by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and four American cities that brought a global warming lawsuit against the bank as well as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), contending that the agencies provided financial assistance to projects without first evaluating the projects’ global warming impacts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_005">Friends of the Earth, “Landmark Global Warming Lawsuit Settled,” press release, February 6, 2009, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://action.foe.org/t/6545/pressRelease.jsp?press_release_KEY=486">http://action.foe.org/t/6545/pressRelease.jsp?press_release_KEY=486</a>.</span> The lawsuit took seven years to resolve, but in the end the courts ruled that Ex-Im Bank and OPIC must consider the environmental effect of the projects they fund.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_006">“Settlement Agreement: Export-Import Bank of the United States,” Friends of the Earth, February 6, 2009, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.foe.org/pdf/Ex-Im_Settlement.pdf">http://www.foe.org/pdf/Ex-Im_Settlement.pdf</a>; “Victory!,” <em class="emphasis">ClimateLawsuit.org</em>, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.foe.org/climate/climatelawsuit/index.htm">http://www.foe.org/climate/climatelawsuit/index.htm</a>.</span></p>

It stated that the coal-fired power plant that would be fed by the mine conflicted with the Obama administration’s environmental goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_008">Mark Drajem, “Reliance Power’s India Plan Rejected by U.S. Export-Import Bank,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, June 26, 2010, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-26/reliance-power-s-india-plan-rejected-by-u-s-export-import-bank.html">http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-26/reliance-power-s-india-plan-rejected-by-u-s-export-import-bank.html</a>.</span> The guarantees would have backed loans that Reliance would have used to purchase mining equipment from Bucyrus.

Sullivan argued that the rejection could result in a loss of $600 million in equipment sales for Bucyrus and up to 1,000 US jobs could be at stake.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_010">Patrick McIlheran, “Reprieve for Bucyrus in Era of Mojo,” <em class="emphasis">Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel</em>, June 30, 2010, accessed December 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/97521434.html">http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/97521434.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p08">Sullivan fumed at the bank’s rejection of his loan application. He had recently gone out on a limb and made the bold move of convincing his board of directors to spend $250 million to expand and refurbish Bucyrus’s South Milwaukee operations, while the company’s competitors were moving work to China.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_011">Rick Barrett, “Bucyrus Chief Dug Deep for Support,” <em class="emphasis">Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel</em>, July 3, 2010, accessed July 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/97745649.html">http://www.jsonline.com/business/97745649.html</a>.</span> Instead of accepting defeat with the bank’s decision, he went on the attack. Sullivan notified elected officials, many of whom were engaged in reelection campaigns. Given the prevailing tough US economic atmosphere, the officials would likely back an initiative that would retain or increase US jobs. Sullivan also called business and labor union leaders and enlisted support from Bucyrus’s hundreds of suppliers. The president of the United Steelworkers of America, Leo Gerard, appealed to the public to participate in a letter-writing campaign to protest Ex-Im Bank’s refusal to finance mining equipment that would be made by union members. “At a time when we are losing good-paying jobs, and at a time when President Obama wants to double US exports, how can the Export-Import Bank deny a loan that would create and protect jobs at Bucyrus International? It was a dumb decision,” Gerard told the <em class="emphasis">Journal Sentinel</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_012">Rick Barrett, “Obama Visit to Racine Wednesday May Be Pushing Review,” <em class="emphasis">Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel</em>, June 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/97319564.html">http://www.jsonline.com/business/97319564.html</a> accessed November 28, 2010.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p09">As Sullivan rallied potential supporters, luck played its role: President Barack Obama was planning for a town hall meeting in Racine, Wisconsin, just a few miles from Bucyrus’s headquarters. Even better, the town hall meeting topic was the economy. A local business association took out full-page advertisements in the local newspapers asking the president to help reverse the bank’s decision and save US jobs. Sullivan was astute in pushing the right political hot buttons, but getting Obama’s attention would have been much harder had he not been coming to Racine.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s00_p10">It is important to remember that Bucyrus is not a coal miner but instead a supplier to that industry, so Ex-Im Bank’s complaint was really with Bucyrus’s customer, Reliance.

Accounting standards cover topics such as how to account for inventories, depreciation, research and development costs, income taxes, investments, intangible assets, and employee benefits.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p01">The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is the major entity proposing international standards of accounting. Originally formed in 1973 as the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and renamed the International Accounting Standards Board in 2001, the IASB is an independent agency that develops accounting standards known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international financial reporting standards (IFRS)</a><span class="glossdef">Standards that are developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for reporting company financial results and that are followed by over one hundred nations throughout the world.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_025">“History,” International Accounting Standards Board, accessed November 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ifrs.org/Home.htm">http://www.ifrs.org/Home.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p02">The IASB is composed of fifteen representatives from professional accounting firms from many countries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_026">“About the IFRS Foundation and the IASB,” IFRS Foundation, accessed November 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ifrs.org/The+organisation/IASCF+and+IASB.htm">http://www.ifrs.org/The+organisation/IASCF+and+IASB.htm</a>.</span> These board members formulate the international reporting standards. For a standard to be approved, 75 percent of the board members must agree. Often, getting agreement is difficult given the social, economic, legal, and cultural differences among countries. As a result, most IASB statements provide two acceptable alternatives. Two alternatives aren’t as solid or straightforward as one, but it’s better than having a dozen different options.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p03">Adherence to the IASB’s standards is voluntary, but many countries have mandated use of IFRS. For example, all companies listed on EU stock exchanges are required to use IFRS.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_027">European Commission, “Report to the European Securities Committee and to the European Parliament,” April 6, 2010, accessed November 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=com:2010:0292:fin:en:html">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=com:2010:0292:fin:en:html</a>.</span> The same is true for all companies listed on South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Turkey’s Istanbul Stock Exchange. In all, over one hundred nations have adopted or permitted companies to use the IASB’s standards to report their financial results.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_028">Neil Baker, “IFAC Calls for Crucial Reporting Roadmap,” <em class="emphasis">Compliance Week</em>, July 27, 2009, accessed November 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.complianceweek.com/blog/glimpses/2009/07/27/ifac-calls-for-reporting-roadmap">http://www.complianceweek.com/blog/glimpses/2009/07/27/ifac-calls-for-reporting-roadmap</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p04">The United States doesn’t mandate using the IFRS.

The US currently mandates following GAAP. However, the FASB and IASB are working on harmonizing the accounting standards; many IASB standards are similar to FASB ones. The United States is moving toward adopting the IFRS but hasn’t committed to a specific time frame.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_029">Marie Leone, “Harvey Goldschmid Named IASB Trustee,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, December 11, 2009, accessed November 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/14461503">http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/14461503</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p05">The primary reason for adopting one standard internationally is that if different accounting standards are used, it’s difficult for investors or lenders to compare the financial health of two companies. In addition, if a single international standard is used, multinational firms won’t have to prepare different reports for the different countries in which they operate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p06">Accounting standards can be complex; and this makes modification of standards difficult. In addition, differing practices among various nations add to the complications of a unified accounting format. For example, in the United States and Great Britain, individual investors provide a substantial source of capital to companies, so accounting rules are designed to help individual investors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_030">CIRCA, “International Accounting Norms: Background and Recent Developments in the EU,” accessed November 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/accstat/info/data/en/accounting%20for%20website.htm">http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/accstat/info/data/en/accounting%20for%20website.htm</a>.</span> In contrast, the tradition in Switzerland, Germany, and Japan is for companies to rely more on banks for funding. Companies in these countries have a tighter relationship with banks. This means that less information is disclosed to the public. It also results in accounting rules that value assets conservatively to protect a bank’s investment. In other countries, the government steps in to make loans or invest in companies whose activities are in the “national interest.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s02_p07">Finally, accounting rules in China follow neither IFRS nor GAAP, which makes it hard for investors to gauge the true value of a company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_031">Doug McIntyre, “Chinese Accounting: Greek to Many,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, June 18, 2007, accessed November 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/06/18/china-accounting-gaap-pf-education-in_dm_0618investopedia_inl.html">http://www.forbes.com/2007/06/18/china-accounting-gaap-pf-education-in_dm_0618investopedia_inl.html</a>.</span> To address this issue, some large Chinese companies report results in both Chinese accounting standards and the IASB’s standards. The two accounting standards can show quite different results for the same company, which is why convergence proponents advocate using one global accounting standard.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Characteristics of International Accounting Standards and Their Implications for International Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_p01">On one hand, having to adhere to GAAP rules as well as IFRS rules creates extra labor and paperwork for multinational firms. For example, a US company seeking to raise funds in Germany has to prepare a financial report according to IFRS accounting rules as well as US GAAP rules. Further problems arise when different country accounting rules make the financial statements look different. If the same transaction is accounted for in different ways based on different country accounting rules, the comparability of financial reports is undermined.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_p02">In some instances, the differences between US GAAP rules and IFRS are significant. For example, the last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting method is allowed by GAAP but banned by IFRS. Some firms, such as aluminum company Alcoa, receive a tax benefit from using the LIFO method.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_032">Marie Leone, “Unfazed by IFRS,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, April 30, 2010, accessed August 10, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14495043">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14495043</a>.</span> If IFRS is mandated for all US companies, firms like Alcoa may need to make significant cash-tax payments. This is why US adoption of IFRS is taking time, and why the FASB and IASB are working hard to harmonize the standards.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_p03">On the positive side, other companies, like IBM, may gain greater efficiencies and stronger controls from a move to IFRS. For example, converting to IFRS would make it possible for IBM to create a globally shared service center for accounting, rather than having accounting departments in different regions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_033">Marie Leone, “Unfazed by IFRS,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, April 30, 2010, accessed August 10, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14495043">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14495043</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_p04">US adoption of the IASB’s global accounting standards would be useful to big multinational companies. Tyco International, for example, is the parent of 1,200 legal entities, 900 of them outside the United States. For Tyco, having to follow only IFRS rules would be positive, because it would enable Tyco to prepare financials on the same basis worldwide and to more freely move accounting staff from country to country and business to business. Nonetheless, given Tyco’s massive network of information systems, making the switch would still be “a tremendous amount of work,” according to John Davidson, the company’s controller and chief accounting officer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_034">David McCann, “IFRS: Jekyll or Hyde?,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, November 20, 2009, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14456597/c_14457492">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14456597/c_14457492</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_p05">Some smaller public companies, however, would see only costs from a move to IFRS. Davey Tree Expert Company, for example, which only does business in the United States and Canada, sees no benefits. Because the company is unlikely to ever list on any national exchange, the argument that unified standards would allow comparability of financials has no value.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_035">David McCann, “IFRS: Jekyll or Hyde?,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, November 20, 2009, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14456597/c_14457492">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14456597/c_14457492</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_p06">An interim step toward the United States adopting IFRS is to permit US firms that operate globally to file only under IFRS, rather than under both GAAP and IFRS, thereby reducing their financial-statement preparation costs.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>The purpose of accounting is to communicate an organization’s financial position to company managers, investors, banks, and the government. Accounting provides a system of rules and principles that prescribe the format and content of financial statements. Through this consistent reporting, a company’s managers and investors can assess the financial health of the firm.</li>
                <li>Historically, countries have followed different accounting standards. If different accounting standards are used, however, it’s difficult for investors or lenders to compare two companies or determine their financial condition. US firms and any listed on a US stock exchange must prepare financial statements in accordance with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards, which are known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Firms based in the European Union (EU) follow standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) known as international financial reporting standards (IFRS). Over one hundred nations have adopted or permit companies to use IFRS to report their financial results. The United States is moving toward adopting IFRS but hasn’t committed to a time frame. The FASB and IASB are working on harmonizing the two accounting standards.</li>
                <li>The three main advantages of a single set of international accounting standards are (1) an increased comparability between firms, which reduces investor risk and facilitates cross-border financing and investment; (2) a reduction in the cost of preparing consolidated financial statements for multinational firms; and (3) the improved reliability and credibility of financial reports.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s01_p01">Multinational firms often organize as separate legal entities (i.e., companies) in different countries to gain advantages, such as limiting liability or taking advantage of local corporate tax regulations. Also, many countries mandate that companies that do business in their country set up a separate company in that country. As a result, a multinational company may have numerous foreign subsidiaries, all owned by the parent. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consolidated financial statement</a><span class="glossdef">A single financial statement that brings together all the financial statements of a parent company and its subsidiaries.</span></span> brings together all the financial statements of a parent and its subsidiaries into a single financial statement. The consolidated financial statement must reconcile all the investment and capital accounts as well as the assets, liabilities, and operating accounts of the firms. Consolidated financial statements demonstrate that firms—although legally separate from the parent and each other—are in fact economically interdependent. Most of the developed nations require consolidated statements so that losses can’t be hidden under an unconsolidated subsidiary. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) standards mandate the use of consolidated financial statements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s01_p02">Consolidating financial statements of subsidiaries located in different countries poses problems because of the different currencies used in different countries. Companies must decide on what basis they will translate those different currencies into the home currency of the parent company.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Currency Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s02_p01">Currency values fluctuate from day to day relative to each other, which poses a risk for firms that operate internationally. Currency risk is the risk of a change in the exchange rate that will adversely affect the company. Companies face this risk because they typically price their products and services in the local currency of each country in which they operate, to make it easy for local customers to understand the pricing and make the purchase. This practice exposes companies to currency risk. For example, the US dollar fluctuated from 1.501 dollars per euro in October 2009 to 1.19440 in June 2010.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_036">“Historical Exchange Rates,” <em class="emphasis">OANDA</em>, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates?date_fmt=us&amp;date=10/26/09&amp;date1=02/25/09&amp;exch=EUR&amp;exch2=EUR&amp;expr=USD&amp;expr2=USD&amp;format=HTML&amp;margin_fixed=0">http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates?date_fmt=us&amp;date=10/26/09&amp;date1=02/25/09&amp;exch=EUR&amp;exch2=EUR&amp;expr=USD&amp;expr2=USD&amp;format=HTML&amp;margin_fixed=0</a>.</span> This means that if a US company were selling a product for 1,000 euros, the company would receive $1,501 dollars for it in October 2009 but only $1,194 for it in June 2010. To preserve profits, the company might raise the euro-denominated price of its products, but the company would risk a drop in sales due to the increased price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s02_p02">In a simple example, currency fluctuations mean that if a US-based company sold its product in Germany at a 10 percent profit and the currency value of the dollar dropped 10 percent relative to the euro, then the profit would be wiped out.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s02_p03">Companies can mitigate currency risk by engaging in hedging. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hedging</a><span class="glossdef">Using financial instruments to reduce adverse price movements by taking an offsetting position.</span></span> refers to using financial instruments to reduce adverse price movements by taking an offsetting position.

Thus, the firm will pay the agreed-on exchange rate regardless of what the current exchange rate is at the date of the final settlement.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Currency Fluctuations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s04_p01">When the Chinese government announced in 2010 that it would allow its currency, the yuan, to float more freely in relation to other world currencies, US CFOs knew that the change would affect their currency-risk picture. When the yuan was pegged to the dollar (from 2008 to 2010), China’s currency had less value, which gave China an advantage in global trade. China’s goods were cheaper in world markets. Once the yuan floats more freely, it’s expected to appreciate against the dollar.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s04_p02">The yuan’s appreciation against the dollar will most likely bring two results. First, it will bring Chinese consumers’ purchasing power closer to parity around the world. Second, manufacturing in China will be more expensive than it was in the past, which brings about two results of its own. Foreign firms may move their manufacturing operations out of China (or not open them there in the first place) as they search for the lowest costs elsewhere, and the yuan’s value appreciation in the long term means that Chinese products will become more expensive for other countries to buy, which will force China to move from manufacturing lower-margin products like toys and shoes to higher-end businesses. These higher-end areas will bring China into more direct competition with the United States and Europe.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_037">Kate O’Sullivan, “Freeing the Yuan,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, June 23, 2010, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14506658">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14506658</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s04_s01_p01">One way to deal with the problem of currency fluctuations is to use the forward-exchange-rate method. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">forward exchange rate</a><span class="glossdef">The rate at which two parties agree to exchange currency and execute a deal at some specific point in the future, usually 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or 180 days in the future.</span></span> is the rate at which two parties agree to exchange currency and execute a deal at some specific point in the future, usually 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or 180 days in the future. The firms agree up front on the rate at which they’ll exchange currencies, although the actual delivery of the foreign currency will be at a future specified date. For example, a multinational firm based in Spain might sign a contract with a US bank to buy US dollars for euros 90 days from now at a specified exchange rate. The Spanish corporation would use the forward exchange rate as a way to reduce exchange-rate risk if the value of the euro decreases substantially relative to the US dollar.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s04_s01_p02">If two subsidiaries of the same multinational firm do a currency exchange, then they can use an internal forward rate.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s02_s04_s01_l01">
                    <li>Multinational firms often organize as separate legal entities (i.e., companies) in different countries to gain advantages such as limiting liability or taking advantage of local corporate tax regulations. A consolidated financial statement brings together all the financial statements of a parent and its subsidiaries into a single financial statement. Consolidating financial statements of subsidiaries located in different countries poses problems because of the different currencies used in different countries.</li>
                    <li>Currency values fluctuate from day to day relative to each other. Companies can mitigate currency risk by engaging in hedging. Hedging refers to using financial instruments to reduce adverse price movements by taking an offsetting position. Specifically, a firm can lock in a guaranteed foreign exchange rate through a forward contract. In a forward contract, a firm agrees to pay a specific rate at the beginning of the contract for delivery at a future date.</li>
                    <li>Companies must decide what method they’ll use to translate different currencies into the home currency of the parent company. Under the current-rate method of currency translation, items in the subsidiaries’ financial statements are translated at the current exchange rate (i.e., the rate on the date when the statements are prepared) into the currency of the parent corporation. Under the temporal method, firms use the exchange rate based on the rate in place when the assets and liabilities were originally acquired or incurred.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s03_s01_p03">Sources of financing available to firms include foreign stock exchanges, foreign bond markets, foreign banks, venture-capital firms, and funding from the parent company. Although global equity and debt markets offer firms a new way to get funding—often at lower cost than US markets—they are also complicated by foreign currency and exchange rates.</p>

The advantage of raising capital in equity markets is that the firm doesn’t have to repay the money at a specific time or at a specific interest rate, as it does with bank loans. The disadvantage is that each time a firm offers stock, the firm’s management loses some control of the company because shareholders can now vote to approve or disallow management actions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p01">Multinational firms choose to raise money in foreign markets for a number of reasons. For example, French luxury beauty products company L’Occitane conducted its initial public offering (IPO) on Hong Kong’s stock exchange, rather than on the stock exchange in its home country—the NYSE Euronext in Paris.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_038">Peter Bisson, Rik Kirkland, and Elizabeth Stephenson, “The Great Rebalancing,” <em class="emphasis">McKinsey Quarterly</em>, June 2010, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_great_rebalancing_2627">http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_great_rebalancing_2627</a>.</span> L’Occitane made this decision because emerging-market consumers are its fastest-growing segment. Listing on Hong Kong’s exchange makes the company more visible in these growing markets and lets locals participate in the growth of the firm by buying shares.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p02">Some multinational firms raise money in both their home-country and overseas stock exchanges. One of the reasons for listing on multiple exchanges is a lower cost of capital as shares become available to global investors who might not otherwise be able to purchase shares due to international investment barriers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p03">Emerging markets are also opening stock exchanges.

A-shares are local shares denominated in China’s local currency for domestic investors. B-shares are denominated in Hong Kong dollars or US dollars and are generally owned by foreigners. H-shares are for China-incorporated companies traded in Hong Kong. Chinese authorities (the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the People’s Bank of China, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange) closely regulate the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Indeed, the Chinese government actively intervenes in its capital markets. For example, it didn’t allow any new equity funds to be established in 2007. The government also owns a relatively high number of shares in many listed companies. China’s low transparency, poor implementation of securities regulations, and restrictions on hedging and risk-management tools are warning signs to foreign investment-fund executives. At the same time, the government lacks many regulations related to educating or protecting investors. A brokerage firm can allow an investor to buy and sell any amount of any security after the investor answers three questions in the following areas: name, health, and risk tolerance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_039">Matt Anderson, Daniel Curtis, Derek Lin, and Ian Van Reepinghen, “Coming of Age: A Look at China’s New Generation of Investors,” in The Lauder Institute, <em class="emphasis">Lauder Global Business Insight Report 2010: First-Hand Perspectives on the Global Economy</em> (Philadelphia: Wharton, University of Pennsylvania, 2010), 69–73, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/papers/download/021710_GlobalBiz_2010.pdf">http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/papers/download/021710_GlobalBiz_2010.pdf</a>.</span></p>

Even China now has an active bond market. Before April 2008, Chinese state-owned enterprises were about the only ones issuing corporate debt in China because corporate bonds were so costly and time-consuming to issue there. Corporate bonds had to be listed on the stock exchange and approved by exchange regulators, making the process subject to political whims. State-owned enterprises raised money in the bond market to finance big infrastructure projects, and the bonds had state guarantees. In 2008, new rules simplified the issuing process, and the Chinese government began letting foreign companies issue yuan-denominated bonds through Hong Kong in 2010. The attraction of the Chinese bond market, according to Chris Zhou, director of debt capital markets at UBS Securities in Beijing, is that “the bond market is a relatively easy and cost-effective way to get money.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_040">Frederik Balfour, “In China, A Burst of Corporate Bonds,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek,</em> July 6, 2009, 25.</span></p>

In particular, Brazil made high school available to all citizens and invested in higher education, science, and technology. The result of these government investments is that not only does Brazil have a more educated workforce, but it has also narrowed off the gap between rich and poor and between ethnically divided segments of Brazilian society. In contrast, countries with deep ethnic and racial inequities aren’t unified societies, which leads to mediocre economic performance. Brazil plans to invest another $22 billion in science and technology innovation in 2010 and seeks corporations to join in additional investments in the country.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_045">Jeffrey Sachs, “Economics for a Crowded Planet” (webinar, HSM Global, 2009), accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://us.hsmglobal.com/contenidos/hsm-webinars-sachs.html">http://us.hsmglobal.com/contenidos/hsm-webinars-sachs.html</a>; Jeffrey Sachs, <em class="emphasis">The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time</em> (New York: Penguin, 2005).</span></p>

IBM’s Palmisano praised Brazil’s strategy: “Investments in innovation are critical, especially in a downturn. They can help Brazil and other countries, including the US, realize an economic expansion.” Among the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), Brazil is seeing the highest growth in business partners that IBM works with, averaging 150 percent year over year, according to Claudia Fan Munce, managing director of IBM Venture Capital Group.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_046">Steve Hamm, “Big Blue’s Global Lab,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, August 27, 2009, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145040683083.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_36/b4145040683083.htm</a>; Spencer E.

The lack of parallelism leads to confusion and misinterpretation.

Economic risks are often paired with political risks but can also arise from international money markets. Both risks are exacerbated by increased volatility and changes in laws.</p>

The volatility arises because this major economy isn’t a developed state with commitment to the rule of law and strong institutions. Rather, it’s an emerging market where political insecurities are the ultimate driver, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group and author of <em class="emphasis">The End of the Free Market</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_054">Rik Kirkland, “China’s State Capitalism and Multinationals: An Interview with the President of Eurasia Group,” <em class="emphasis">McKinsey Quarterly</em>, May 2010, accessed November 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Chinas_state_capitalism_and_multinationals_An_interview_with_the_president_of_Eurasia_Group_2583">http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Chinas_state_capitalism_and_multinationals_An_interview_with_the_president _of_Eurasia_Group_2583</a>.</span></p>

In most countries, if the supplier goes bankrupt, GM can easily take the tooling back. But GM noted that this isn’t possible in China due to the nascent state of the country’s bankruptcy law, which was created only in 1988.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_056">Harjeet S.

Rebecca Norton, vice president of finance, Asia-Pacific, at Business Objects (a unit of SAP), makes it a point to participate in global conference calls as often as possible, in order to “wave the Asia-Pacific flag.” She notes that this is necessary to ensure that her overseas colleagues understand the conditions under which the Asian business operates.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_057">Don Durfee, “Local Knowledge,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, November 1, 2008, accessed August 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/12465219">http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/12465219</a>.</span> The reason for the frequent communication is to help the home office better understand the opportunities and risks of the foreign country. For example, if headquarters is focused on short-term performance indicators, the head office is more likely to allocate funds to developed markets where returns are quick. But this approach neglects emerging markets, which have more future potential.</p>

The North America SSC provided a number of accounting services globally. Although the US-based SSC had a much higher cost of labor than Singapore (where 3Com offshored transaction-based processes), 3Com decided to keep higher-value services in the North America SSC due to 3Com’s assessment of the risk and complexity in comparison to the anticipated benefit of moving these from one global center to another.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s04_s03_p01">Companies operating in countries where Islam is the official religion, such as Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Yemen, must adhere to Islamic finance laws. Islamic law prohibits certain financial practices that are common in other countries. For example, Islamic law (called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sharia</a><span class="glossdef">Islamic law; in terms of finance, prohibits charging interest on money and other common business activities, including short selling.</span></span>) prohibits charging interest on money. No interest can be charged, including fixed-rate, floating, simple, or compounded interest, at whatever rate. The Sharia also prohibits financial practices like speculation, conventional insurance, and derivatives, because they’re considered gambling in the Islamic tradition. Sharia also prohibits <em class="emphasis">gharar</em>, which means “uncertainty” and includes conventional practices like short selling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s04_s03_p02">To overcome these prohibitions, financial products must be Sharia compliant. There are approved alternatives to interest and speculative investments. For example, instead of lending money and charging interest, banks can lend money and earn profits by charging rentals on the asset leased to the customer. One alternative investment strategy, <em class="emphasis">musharakah</em>, allows profit and loss sharing. It’s a partnership wherein profits are shared per an agreed-on ratio and losses are shared in proportion to the capital or investment of each partner. A <em class="emphasis">mudarabah</em> is an investment partnership, whereby the investor provides capital to another party or entrepreneur in order to undertake a business or investment activity. While profits are shared on an agreed-on ratio, loss of investment is born only by the investor. The entrepreneurs only lose their share of the expected income.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_064">“Introduction to Islamic Financing,” HSBC Amanah, accessed August 14, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.com/gam/attachments/mena/amanah/islamic_invest.pdf">http://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.com/gam/attachments/mena/amanah/islamic_invest.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s04_s03_p03">These investment arrangements demonstrate the Sharia’s risk-sharing philosophy—the lender must share in the borrower’s risk. Since fixed, predetermined interest rates guarantee a return to the lender and fall disproportionately on the borrower, they are seen as exploitative, socially unproductive, and economically wasteful. The preferred mode of financing is profit and loss sharing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s04_s03_p04">Islamic finance law extends to mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, and other nonbanks.

                <li>Political and economic risks arise when a country lacks a long history or commitment to the rule of law. Companies can prepare for volatility by thinking through “unthinkable” scenarios and planning how they would respond if such situations occurred.</li>
                <li>Multinational firms can organize their financial operations in a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid organization structure. The advantages of a centralized structure are that the company can afford to hire and retain specialized staff who have deep expertise and can bring savings to the company through centralized cash management and more efficient capital investment. Centralization also enables the firm to gain economies of scale for investment and borrowing activities that will reduce transaction costs and get the firm the most competitive pricing. On the other hand, a decentralized financial organization structure allows the firm to recognize the variations in language, customs, cultures, business practices, rules, laws, and regulations among different countries. A decentralized structure lets multinational firms exploit local knowledge and business conditions to deal with uncertainty.</li>
                <li>It’s important for regional CFOs to stay in regular contact with corporate headquarters to alert headquarters to opportunities (or warn them of dangers) in their countries.</li>
                <li>Islamic countries practice Sharia—the prohibition of charging interest on money. There are approved, Sharia-compliant alternatives to interest and speculative investments.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Global Money Management and Centralized Depositories</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s01_p01">Global money management involves moving money across borders and managing the firm’s financial resources in a way that minimizes taxes and transaction fees while maximizing the firm’s returns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s01_p02">A multinational company can make the most of its cash reserves by holding cash balances at a central location, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">centralized depository</a><span class="glossdef">A central location where the cash balances of a parent and its subsidiaries are pooled.</span></span>. There are two main advantages of centralized depositories:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>The company earns a higher interest on higher amounts of cash, because cash from across the company is pooled.</li>
            <li>Pooling cash reserves reduces the total amount of cash that the company needs to hold, because the amount of cash held on hand as a precautionary measure against the unexpected can be pooled and thus reduced—it’s unlikely that all the worst cases will happen simultaneously.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s01_p03">Centralized money management also lets a company trade currencies between its subsidiaries and thereby eliminate intermediaries like banks. This practice saves the firm transaction costs. Centralization also means that the company can buy currencies in larger lot sizes, which gives it a better price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s01_p04">Two facts are important to keep in mind when using the centralized depository technique for global cash management. First, a government can restrict how much capital can flow out of the country (governments do this to preserve foreign exchange reserves). Second, there are transaction costs associated with moving money across borders, and these costs are incurred each time the money is moved.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s02_p01">Companies need to be aware of differences in local cash practices. For example, business customers in Asia often pay their invoices via bank draft—a common method there, but almost unheard of in the United States. This approach typically means a company gets its cash slowly, creating potential working-capital problems. “If you sell to a customer on 30-day terms and on day 29 they give you a bank draft, that’s three months more you’ll have to wait,” said Brian Kenny, CFO of specialty chemicals materials company W. R. Grace’s Asia-Pacific division.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_066">Don Durfee, “Local Knowledge,” <em class="emphasis">CFO</em>, November 1, 2008, accessed August 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/12465219">http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/12465219</a>.</span></p>

Three or more subsidiaries must participate. (If only two participate, the technique is known as bilateral netting.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s02_s01_p02">For example, let’s say a firm’s subsidiary in the Czech Republic owes the Australian subsidiary $4 million, while the Australian subsidiary owes the Czech subsidiary $10 million. Rather than the Czech subsidiary transferring $4 million and the Australian transferring $10 million, the parties agree to one payment in which the Australian subsidiary pays the Czech $6 million. Both payments are thus satisfied. The total funds that flowed between the subsidiaries are reduced from $14 million to $6 million, reducing costs. For example, if the transaction costs (i.e., the foreign exchange commission plus the transfer fees) are 1 percent of the total funds transferred, the transaction costs in this example drop from $140,000 to $60,000. In cases where multiple subsidiaries trade amongst each other, the savings are even more significant. For example, if four subsidiaries each trade with three other subsidiaries, the total number of transactions can be reduced from twelve to three, which reduces transaction costs substantially.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s02_s01_p03">In a real-life example, Colgate-Palmolive operates in 218 countries. Much of its manufacturing operations are centralized rather than being located in numerous countries around the world. As a result, subsidiaries do a lot of business with each other. Colgate headquarters requires that all subsidiaries submit and settle their payments to each other on the same day. By directing all settlements to one day, Colgate maximizes the benefits of multilateral netting and saves on the spread. This reduces the transaction costs as well as the risk of currency fluctuations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_067">Kabir Masson, “‘Managing International Financial Risk’: A Presentation by Hans L.

The advantage of using fronting loans as a way to lend money, rather than the parent lending the money directly to the subsidiary, is that the parent can gain some tax benefits and bypass local laws that restrict the amount of funds that can be transferred abroad. With a fronting loan, the parent deposits the total amount of the loan in the bank. The bank then lends the money to the subsidiary. For the bank, the loan is risk free, because the parent has provided the money to the bank. The bank charges the subsidiary a slightly higher interest rate on the loan than it pays to the parent, thus making a profit.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Transfer Pricing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_p01">Multinational firms that conduct business among their cross-border subsidiaries can use tax-advantageous transfer pricing. Transfers occur when a company transfers goods or services between its subsidiaries in different countries. For example, a firm might design a product in one country, manufacture it in a second country, assemble it in a third country, and then sell it around the world. Each time the good or service is transferred between subsidiaries, one subsidiary sells it to the other. The question is, what price should be paid? The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transfer price</a><span class="glossdef">The price that one subsidiary (or subunit of the company) charges another subsidiary (or subunit) for a product or service supplied to that subsidiary.</span></span> is the price that one subsidiary (or subunit of the company) charges another subsidiary (or subunit) for a product or service supplied to that subsidiary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_p02">Since the pricing taking place is between entities owned by the same parent firm, there’s an opportunity for pricing an item or service at significantly above or below cost in order to gain advantages for the firm overall. For example, transfer pricing can be a way to bring profits back to the home country from countries that restrict the amount of earnings that multinational firms can take out of the country. In this case, the firm may charge its foreign subsidiary a high price, thus extracting more money out of the country. The firm would use a cost-plus markup method for arriving at the transfer price, rather than using market prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_p03">Although this practice optimizes results for the company as a whole, it may bring morale problems for the subsidiaries whose profits are impacted negatively from such manipulation. In addition, the pricing makes it harder to determine the actual profit which the favored subsidiary would bring to the company <em class="emphasis">without</em> such favored treatment. Finally, all the price manipulations need to remain compliant with local regulations. In fact, to combat such potential losses of income tax revenue, more than forty countries have adopted transfer-pricing rules and requirements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_069">“Driving Indirect Tax Performance—Managing the Global Reform Challenge,” KPMG, April 2010, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Pages/Driving-indirect-tax-performance-Global-reform.aspx">http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Pages/Driving-indirect-tax-performance-Global-reform.aspx</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_p04">Generally, compliance with local tax regulations means setting prices such that they satisfy the “arm’s length principle.” That is, the prices must be consistent with third-party market results. The test of fairness is, “What would an independent company, operating in a competitive market, charge for performing comparable services or selling similar products?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_070">Alfredo (Jay) Urquidi and David R. Jarczyk, “The Importance of Economics in the Practice of Transfer Pricing,” <em class="emphasis">Transfer Pricing International Journal</em>, May 26, 2010, accessed November 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ceterisgroup.com/files/Articles/Urquidi-Jarczyk-Economics_May10.pdf">http://www.ceterisgroup.com/files/Articles/Urquidi-Jarczyk-Economics_May10.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_p05">Nonetheless, even within these guidelines, multinational firms can adjust prices to shift income from a higher-tax country to a lower-tax one. Governments, of course, are instituting or revising legislation to ensure maximum taxes are collected in their own countries. As a result, multinational firms must monitor compliance with local transfer-pricing regulations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_071">Alfredo (Jay) Urquidi and David R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_s01_p01">One way that governments respond to budget shortfalls is by imposing or increasing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">indirect taxes</a><span class="glossdef">Taxes that are shifted to another person or entity, like the value-added tax (VAT) and goods-and services tax (GST), which are levied on the seller but are passed on and paid by buyers.</span></span> like the value-added tax (VAT) and goods-and-services tax (GST). The reach of these indirect taxes is extending into new areas of the global economy. “The slow economy and falling direct-tax rates are causing many governments worldwide to tighten their existing indirect-tax regimes or introduce new ones,” said Frank Sangster, a principal in KPMG’s US Indirect Tax practice. “Finance and tax directors must be proactive in considering how their organizations are responding to the global VAT changes, which are already affecting their markets, operations and internal systems.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_072">“U.S. Multinationals Expected to Feel Impact of Accelerated Global Move to VAT,” <em class="emphasis">SmartPros</em>, May 3, 2010, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://accounting.smartpros.com/x69387.xml">http://accounting.smartpros.com/x69387.xml</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_s01_p02">More countries are coming to rely on VAT as a significant and stable source of tax revenue, so these taxes are unlikely to diminish. China and India are considering introducing national VAT systems for the first time, while European Union (EU) countries might be looking at ways to raise more revenue through VAT. International companies can assess and manage the risks and opportunities of new VAT systems by using merging technologies to increase automation of the indirect tax process, deciding whether to insource or outsource new compliance obligations, and using modeling techniques to assess the impact of local VAT changes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_073">“U.S. Multinationals Expected to Feel Impact of Accelerated Global Move to VAT,” <em class="emphasis">SmartPros</em>, May 3, 2010, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://accounting.smartpros.com/x69387.xml">http://accounting.smartpros.com/x69387.xml</a>; “Driving Indirect Tax Performance—Managing the Global Reform Challenge,” KPMG, April 2010, accessed October 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Pages/Driving-indirect-tax-performance-Global-reform.aspx">http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Pages/Driving-indirect-tax-performance-Global-reform.aspx</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch15_s05_s03_s01_p03">Manufacturing shoes in China for the Chinese market is subject to a 17 percent VAT, for example, but shoes for export aren’t subject to this tax. In some cases, it may be cheaper to make the shoes in China, export them to Hong Kong, reimport them into China, and pay import duties instead of VAT. Local import/export regulations can also impact where companies decide to locate specific functions of the supply chain, such as distribution centers or warehouses. In Fujian province, one can import materials one day and export the output the next day. In Guangdong province, in contrast, the local authorities insist on thirty days’ notice for reexported materials. The point is that each emerging-market country and even each region in an emerging-market country can have its own interplay of taxes, duties, and regulatory delays that affect how companies design their operations and the margins they’re able achieve.</p>

            <li>Coca-Cola operates thirty-nine bottling plants in China.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_076">“Coca-Cola on the Yangtze: A Corporate Campaign for Clean Water in China,” <em class="emphasis">Knowledge@Wharton</em>, August 18, 2010, accessed August 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2568">http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2568</a>.</span> China is an important market for Coca-Cola. The company’s sales in volume grew 19 percent in China in 2009 while declining 1 percent in the United States. Coca-Cola also hopes to expand its business into the juice, dairy, and ready-to-drink markets. It had offered $2.3 billion to buy Chinese company China Huiyuan Juice to get a strong (20 percent) share in China’s juice market. Chinese regulators, however, rejected the deal. In 2004, Coca-Cola was forced to shut down one of its bottling plants in south India after community organizers blamed it for causing water shortages there. (A year earlier PepsiCo’s plant in the same state also lost its operating license for similar reasons.) Coca-Cola is now partnered with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to improve the water quality of the Yangtze River, which is the longest river in Asia and supplies 35 percent of China’s water but is now the most threatened river in the world due to pollution. Coca-Cola is working with rural farmers, for example, to reduce runoff from animal waste into the river by turning it into biogas for cooking and heating instead. The company has pledged $24 million over seven years to support fresh-water programs globally. It’s also striving to be “water neutral” by making its “waste” water pure enough for agricultural irrigation and completely offsetting the amount of water it uses in its soft-drink products by funding clean-water projects and watershed preservation efforts around the world. What do you think of these moves by Coca-Cola? On the one hand, as the world’s largest beverage company, its water-neutral plan could make a big difference, and its clout brings attention to the world water issue. On the other hand, bringing attention to the issue could put the spotlight on the company itself, which uses 2.5 liters of water to make a liter of Coke. In fact, when looking across the whole supply chain, 200 liters of water go into making a single liter of Coke (due to water-intensive sugar cane crops). However, looked at from an entire-chain perspective, it takes 140 liters of water to make a cup of coffee and 800 to 1,000 gallons of water to get a single gallon of milk.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn15_077">Peter M. Senge, <em class="emphasis">The Necessary Revolution</em> (New York: Doubleday, 2008), 77–92.</span> If you were a Chinese consumer, would you be more likely to buy Coca-Cola products given the company’s efforts to clean up the Yangtze River? If you were an executive at Coca-Cola, what actions or programs would you recommend or support?</li>
            <li>As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch15_s05#fwk-168388-ch15_s05">Section 15.5 "Global Money Management: Moving Money across Borders"</a>, transfer pricing is legal, and firms can manipulate transfer prices to avoid taxes. The practice, however, violates the spirit of the law in some countries. Should firms engage in this practice? On the other hand, by not taking advantage of these opportunities, would firms be shortchanging their investors?</li>
