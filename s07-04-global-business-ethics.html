            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_p02">The field of ethics (or moral philosophy) involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. Philosophers today usually divide ethical theories into three general subject areas: metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics. <em class="emphasis">Metaethics</em> investigates where our ethical principles come from, and what they mean. Are they merely social inventions? Do they involve more than expressions of our individual emotions? Metaethical answers to these questions focus on the issues of universal truths, the will of God, the role of reason in ethical judgments, and the meaning of ethical terms themselves. <em class="emphasis">Normative ethics</em> takes on a more practical task, which is to arrive at moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct. This may involve articulating the good habits that we should acquire, the duties that we should follow, or the consequences of our behavior on others. Finally, <em class="emphasis">applied ethics</em> involves examining specific controversial issues, such as…animal rights, environmental concerns…capital punishment, or nuclear war.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_011">James Fieser, “Ethics,” <em class="emphasis">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, last updated May 10, 2009, accessed February 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics">http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics</a>.</span></p>

As with this chapter’s review of culture, this section on global business ethics is less about providing you with a tangible list of dos and don’ts than it is about helping you understand the thinking and critical issues that global managers must deal with on an operational and strategic basis.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Where Do Our Values Come From?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p01">Just as people look to history to understand political, technical, and social changes, so too do they look for changes in thinking and philosophy. There’s a history to how thinking has evolved over time. What may or may not have been acceptable just a hundred years ago may be very different today—from how people present themselves and how they act and interact to customs, values, and beliefs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p02">Ethics can be defined as a system of moral standards or values. You know from the discussion in <a class="xref" href="fwk-168388-ch04_s01#fwk-168388-ch04_s01">Section 3.1 "What Is Culture, Anyhow? Values, Customs, and Language"</a> that cultural programming influences our values. A sense of ethics is determined by a number of social, cultural, and religious factors; this sense influences us beginning early in childhood. People are taught how to behave by their families, exposure to education and thinking, and the society in which they live. Ethical behavior also refers to behavior that is generally accepted within a specific culture. Some behaviors are universally accepted—for example, people shouldn’t physically hurt other people. Other actions are less clear, such as discrimination based on age, race, gender, or ethnicity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p03">Culture impacts how local values influence global business ethics. There are differences in how much importance cultures place on specific ethical behaviors. For example, bribery remains widespread in many countries, and while people may not approve of it, they accept it as a necessity of daily life. Each professional is influenced by the values, social programming, and experiences encountered from childhood on. These collective factors impact how a person perceives an issue and the related correct or incorrect behaviors. Even within a specific culture, individuals have different ideas of what constitutes ethical or unethical behavior. Judgments may differ greatly depending on an individual’s social or economic standing, education, and experiences with other cultures and beliefs. Just as in the example of bribery, it should be noted that there is a difference between ethical behavior and normal practice. It may be acceptable to discriminate in certain cultures, even if the people in that society know that it is not right or fair. In global business ethics, people try to understand what the ethical action is and what the normal practice might be. If these are not consistent, the focus is placed on how to encourage ethical actions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p04">While it’s clear that ethics is not religion, values based on religious teachings have influenced our understanding of ethical behavior. Given the influence of Western thought and philosophy over the world in the last few centuries, many would say that global business has been heavily impacted by the mode of thinking that began with the Reformation and post-Enlightenment values, which placed focus on equality and individual rights. In this mode of thinking, it has become accepted that all people in any country and of any background are equal and should have equal opportunity. Companies incorporate this principle in their employment, management, and operational guidelines; yet enforcing it in global operations can be both tricky and inconsistent.</p>
            <div class="callout block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Did You Know?</h3>
                <p class="simpara">What Are the Reformation and Enlightenment?</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p05">Modern political and economic philosophies trace their roots back to the Reformation and Enlightenment. The Reformation was a period of European history in the sixteenth century when Protestant thinkers, led by Martin Luther, challenged the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. As a result of the Reformation, the Catholic Church lost its control over all scientific and intellectual thought. While there were a number of debates and discussions over the ensuing decades and century, the Reformation is widely believed to have led to another historical period called the Age of Enlightenment, which refers to a period in Western philosophical, intellectual, scientific, and cultural life in the eighteenth century. The Enlightenment, as it is commonly called, promoted a set of values in which reason, not religion, was advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority. As a result, it is also known as the Age of Reason.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p06">It’s important to understand the impact and influence of these two critical historical periods on our modern sense of global business ethics. The prevailing corporate values—including those of institutional and individual equality; the right of every employee to work hard and reap the rewards, financial and nonfinancial; corporate social responsibility; and the application of science and reason to all management and operational processes—have their roots in the thoughts and values that arose during these periods.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Impact of Ethics on Global Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_p01">At first, it may seem relatively easy to identify unethical behavior. When the topic of business ethics is raised, most people immediately focus on corruption and bribery. While this is a critical result of unethical behavior, the concept of business ethics and—in the context of this book—global business ethics is much broader. It impacts human resources, social responsibility, and the environment. The areas of business impacted by global perceptions of ethical, moral, and socially responsible behavior include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Ethics and management</li>
            <li>Ethics and corruption</li>
            <li>Corporate social responsibility</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics and Management Practices</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p01">Ethics impacts various aspects of management and operations, including human resources, marketing, research and development, and even the corporate mission.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p02">The role of ethics in management practices, particularly those practices involving human resources and employment, differs from culture to culture. Local culture impacts the way people view the employee-employer relationship. In many cultures, there are no clear social rules preventing discrimination against people based on age, race, gender, sexual preference, handicap, and so on. Even when there are formal rules or laws against discrimination, they may not be enforced, as normal practice may allow people and companies to act in accordance with local cultural and social practices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p03">Culture can impact how people see the role of one another in the workplace. For example, gender issues are at times impacted by local perceptions of women in the workplace. So how do companies handle local customs and values for the treatment of women in the workplace? If you’re a senior officer of an American company, do you send a woman to Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan to negotiate with government officials or manage the local office? Does it matter what your industry is or if your firm is the seller or buyer? <em class="emphasis">In theory</em>, most global firms have clear guidelines articulating antidiscrimination policies. <em class="emphasis">In reality</em>, global businesses routinely self-censor. Companies often determine whether a person—based on their gender, ethnicity, or race—can be effective in a specific culture based on the prevailing values in that culture. The largest and most respected global companies, typically the <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> Global 500, can often make management and employment decisions regardless of local practices. Most people in each country will want to deal with these large and well-respected companies. The person representing the larger company brings the clout of their company to any business interaction. In contrast, lesser-known, midsize, and smaller companies may find that <em class="emphasis">who</em> their representative is will be more important. Often lacking business recognition in the marketplace, these smaller and midsize companies have to rely on their corporate representatives to create the professional image and bond with their in-country counterparts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p04">Cultural norms may make life difficult for the company as well as the employee. In some cultures, companies are seen as “guardians” or paternal figures. Any efforts to lay off or fire employees may be perceived as culturally unethical. In Japan, where lifelong loyalty to the company was expected in return for lifelong employment, the decade-long recession beginning in the 1990s triggered a change in attitude. Japanese companies finally began to alter this ethical perception and lay off workers without being perceived as unethical.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p05">Global corporations are increasingly trying to market their products based not only on the desirability of the goods but also on their social and environmental merits. Companies whose practices are considered unethical may find their global performance impacted when people boycott their products. Most corporations understand this risk. However, ethical questions have grown increasingly complicated, and the “correct” or ethical choice has, in some cases, become difficult to define.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p06">For example, the pharmaceutical industry is involved in a number of issues that have medical ethicists squirming. First, there’s the well-publicized issue of cloning. No matter <em class="emphasis">what</em> choice the companies make about cloning, they are sure to offend a great many consumers. At the same time, pharmaceutical companies must decide whether to forfeit profits and give away free drugs or cheaper medicines to impoverished African nations. Pharmaceutical companies that <em class="emphasis">do</em> donate medicines often promote this practice in their corporate marketing campaigns in hopes that consumers see the companies in a favorable light.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p07">Tobacco companies are similarly embroiled in a long-term ethical debate. Health advocates around the world agree that smoking is bad for a person’s long-term health. Yet in many countries, smoking is not only acceptable but can even confer social status. The United States has banned tobacco companies from adopting marketing practices that target young consumers by exploiting tobacco’s social cache. However, many other countries don’t have such regulations. Should tobacco companies be held responsible for knowingly marketing harmful products to younger audiences in other countries?</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics and Corruption</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p01">To begin our discussion of corruption, let’s first define it in a business context. Corruption is “giving or obtaining advantage through means which are illegitimate, immoral, and/or inconsistent with one’s duty or the rights of others. Corruption often results from patronage.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_012"><em class="emphasis">BusinessDictionary.com</em>, s.v. “corruption,” accessed January 9, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corruption.html">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corruption.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p02">Our modern understanding of business ethics notes that following culturally accepted norms is not always the ethical choice. What may be acceptable at certain points in history, such as racism or sexism, became unacceptable with the further development of society’s mind-set. What happens when cultures change but business practices don’t? Does that behavior become unethical, and is the person engaged in the behavior unethical? In some cultures, there may be conflicts with global business practices, such as in the area of gift giving, which has evolved into bribery—a form of corruption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p03">Paying bribes is relatively common in many countries, and bribes often take the form of <em class="emphasis">grease payments</em>, which are small inducements intended to expedite decisions and transactions. In India and Mexico, for example, a grease payment may help get your phones installed faster—at home or at work. Transparency International tracks illicit behavior, such as bribery and embezzlement, in the public sector in 180 countries by surveying international business executives. It assigns a CPI (Corruption Perceptions Index) rating to each country. New Zealand, Denmark, Singapore, and Sweden have the lowest levels of corruption, while the highest levels of corruption are seen in most African nations, Russia, Myanmar, and Afghanistan.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_013">Transparency International, “Corruption Perceptions Index 2010,” accessed February 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results">http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p04">Even the most respected of global companies has found itself on the wrong side of the ethics issue and the law. In 2008, after years of investigation, Siemens agreed to pay more than 1.34 billion euros in fines to American and European authorities to settle charges that it routinely used bribes and slush funds to secure huge public-works contracts around the world. “Officials said that Siemens, beginning in the mid-1990s, used bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials to secure government contracts for projects like a national identity card project in Argentina, mass transit work in Venezuela, a nationwide cell phone network in Bangladesh and a United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. ‘Their actions were not an anomaly,’ said Joseph Persichini Jr., the head of the Washington office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ‘They were standard operating procedures for corporate executives who viewed bribery as a business strategy.’”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_014">Eric Lichtblau and Carter Dougherty, “Siemens to Pay $1.34 Billion in Fines,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, December 15, 2008, accessed February 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/worldbusiness/16siemens.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/worldbusiness/16siemens.html</a>.</span></p>

                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p10">In the past 12 months one in four people reported paying a bribe to one of nine institutions and services, from health to education to tax authorities. The police are cited as being the most frequent recipient of bribes, according to those surveyed. About 30 per cent of those who had contact with the police reported having paid a bribe.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p11">More than 20 countries have reported significant increases in petty bribery since 2006. The biggest increases were in Chile, Colombia, Kenya, FYR Macedonia, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Senegal and Thailand. More than one in two people in Sub-Saharan Africa reported paying a bribe—more than anywhere else in the world.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p12">Poorer people are twice as likely to pay bribes for basic services, such as education, than wealthier people. A third of all people under the age of 30 reported paying a bribe in the past 12 months, compared to less than one in five people aged 51 years and over.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p13">Most worrying is the fact that bribes to the police have almost doubled since 2006, and more people report paying bribes to the judiciary and for registry and permit services than five years ago.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p14">Sadly, few people trust their governments or politicians.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p16">Gift giving in the global business world is used to establish or pay respects to a relationship. Bribery, on the other hand, is more commonly considered the practice in which an individual would benefit with little or no benefit to the company. It’s usually paid in relation to winning a business deal, whereas gift giving is more likely to be ingrained in the culture and not associated with winning a specific piece of business. Bribery, usually in the form of a cash payment, has reached such high proportions in some countries that even locals express disgust with the corruption and its impact on daily life for businesses and consumers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p17">The practice of using connections to advance business interests exists in just about every country in the world. However, the extent and manner in which it is institutionalized differs from culture to culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p18">In Western countries, connections are viewed informally and sometimes even with a negative connotation. In the United States and other similar countries, professionals prefer to imply that they have achieved success on their own merits and without any connections. Gift giving is not routine in the United States except during the winter holidays, and even then gift giving involves a modest expression. Businesses operating in the United States send modest gifts or cards to their customers to thank them for business loyalty in the previous year. Certain industries, such as finance, even set clear legal guidelines restricting the value of gifts, typically a maximum of $100.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p19">In contrast, Asian, Latin American, and Middle Eastern cultures are quick to value connections and relationships and view them quite positively. Connections are considered essential for success. In Asia, gift giving is so ingrained in the culture, particularly in Japan and China, that it is formalized and structured.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p20">For example, gift giving in Japan was for centuries an established practice in society and is still taken seriously. There are specific guidelines for gift giving depending on the identity of the giver or recipient, the length of the business relationship, and the number of gifts exchanged. The Japanese may give gifts out of a sense of obligation and duty as well as to convey feelings such as gratitude and regret. Therefore, much care is given to the appropriateness of the gift as well as to its aesthetic beauty. Gift giving has always been widespread in Japan.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p21">Today there are still business gift-giving occasions in Japan, specifically <em class="emphasis">oseibo</em> (year’s end) and <em class="emphasis">ochugen</em> (midsummer). These are must-give occasions for Japanese businesses. Oseibo gifts are presented in the first half of December as a token of gratitude for earlier favors and loyalty. This is a good opportunity to thank clients for their business. <em class="emphasis">Ochugen</em> usually occurs in mid-July in Tokyo and mid-August in some other regions. Originally an occasion to provide consolation to the families of those who had died in the first half of the year, ochugen falls two weeks before <em class="emphasis">obon</em>, a holiday honoring the dead.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p22">Businesses operating in Japan at these times routinely exchange oseibo and ochugen gifts. While a professional is not obligated to participate, it clearly earns goodwill. At the most senior levels, it is not uncommon for people to exchange gifts worth $300 or $400. There is an established price level that one should pay for each corporate level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p23">Despite these guidelines, gift giving in Japan has occasionally crossed over into bribery. This level of corruption became more apparent in the 1980s as transparency in global business gained media attention. Asians tend to take a very different view of accountability than most Westerners. In the 1980s and 1990s, several Japanese CEOs resigned in order to apologize and take responsibility for their companies’ practices, even when they did not personally engage in the offending practices. This has become an accepted managerial practice in an effort to preserve the honor of the company. While Japanese CEOs may not step down as quickly as in the past, the notion of honor remains an important business characteristic.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p24">Long an established form of relationship development in all business conducted in Asia, the Arab world, and Africa, gift giving was clearly tipping into outright bribery. In the past two decades, many countries have placed limits on the types and value of gifts while simultaneously banning bribery in any form. In the United States, companies must adhere to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law that specifically bans any form of bribery. Even foreign companies that are either listed on an American stock exchange or conduct business with the US government come under the purview of this law.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p25">There are still global firms that engage in questionable business gift giving; when caught, they face fines and sanctions. But for the most part, firms continue with business as usual. Changing the cultural practices of gift giving is an evolving process that will take time, government attention, and more transparency in the awarding of global business contracts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p26">Companies and their employees routinely try to balance ethical behavior with business interests. While corruption is now widely viewed as unethical, firms still lose business to companies that may be less diligent in adhering to this principle. While the media covers stories of firms that have breached this ethical conduct, the misconduct of many more companies goes undetected. Businesses, business schools, and governments are increasingly making efforts to deter firms and professionals from making and taking bribes. There are still countless less visible gestures that some would argue are also unethical. For example, imagine that an employee works at a firm that wants to land a contract in China. A key government official in China finds out that you went to the business school that his daughter really wants to attend. He asks you to help her in the admission process. Do you? Should you? Is this just a nice thing to do, or is it a potential conflict of interest if you think the official will view your company more favorably? This is a gray area of global business ethics. Interestingly, a professional’s answer to this situation may depend on his or her culture. Cultures that have clear guidelines for right and wrong behavior may see this situation differently than a culture in which doing favors is part of the normal practice. A company may declare this inappropriate behavior, but employees may still do what they think is best for their jobs. Cultures that have a higher tolerance for ambiguity, as this chapter discusses, may find it easier to navigate the gray areas of ethics—when it is not so clear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p27">Most people agree that bribery in any form only increases the cost of doing business—a cost that is either absorbed by the company or eventually passed on to the buyer or consumer in some form. While businesses agree that corruption is costly and undesirable, losing profitable business opportunities to firms that are less ethically motivated can be just as devastating to the bottom line. Until governments in every country consistently monitor and enforce anticorruption laws, bribery will remain a real and very challenging issue for global businesses.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_p01">Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is defined as “the corporate conscience, citizenship, social performance, or sustainable responsible business, and is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international norms.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_016"><em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, s.v. “Corporate social responsibility,” last modified February 17, 2011, accessed February 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_p02">CSR emerged more than three decades ago, and it has gained increasing strength over time as companies seek to generate goodwill with their employees, customers, and stakeholders. “Corporate social responsibility encompasses not only what companies do with their profits, but also how they make them. It goes beyond philanthropy and compliance and addresses how companies manage their economic, social, and environmental impacts, as well as their relationships in all key spheres of influence: the workplace, the marketplace, the supply chain, the community, and the public policy realm.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_017">“Defining Corporate Social Responsibility,” Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative, Harvard Kennedy School, last modified 2008, accessed March 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/init_define.html">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/init_define.html</a>.</span> Companies may support nonprofit causes and organizations, global initiatives, and prevailing themes. Promoting environmentally friendly and green initiatives is an example of a current prevailing theme.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_p03">Coca-Cola is an example of global corporation with a long-term commitment to CSR. In many developing countries, Coca-Cola promotes local economic development through a combination of philanthropy and social and economic development. Whether by using environmentally friendly containers or supporting local education initiatives through its foundation, Coca-Cola is only one of many global companies that seek to increase their commitment to local markets while enhancing their brand, corporate image, and reputation by engaging in socially responsible business practices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-carpibus-fn04_018">“Sustainability,” The Coca-Cola Company, accessed March 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/index.html">http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/index.html</a>.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Enforcement of Ethical Guidelines and Standards</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p01">The concept of culture impacting the perception of ethics is one that many businesspeople debate. While culture does impact business ethics, international companies operate in multiple countries and need a standard set of global operating guidelines. Professionals engage in unethical behavior primarily as a result of their own personal ethical values, the corporate culture within a company, or from unrealistic performance expectations</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p02">In the interest of expediency, many governments—the US government included—may not strictly enforce the rules governing corporate ethics. The practice of gift giving is one aspect of business that many governments don’t examine too closely. Many companies have routinely used gifts to win favor from their customers, without engaging in direct bribery. American companies frequently invite prospective buyers to visit their US facilities or attend company conferences in exotic locales with all expenses paid. These trips often have perks included. Should such spending be considered sales and marketing expenses, as they are often booked, or are these companies engaging in questionable behavior? It’s much harder to answer this question when you consider that most of the company’s global competitors are likely to engage in similarly aggressive marketing and sales behavior.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p03">Governments often do not enforce laws until it’s politically expedient to do so. Take child labor, for example. Technically, companies operating in India or Pakistan are not permitted to use child labor in factories, mines, and other areas of hazardous employment. However, child labor is widespread in these countries due to deep-rooted social and economic challenges. Local governments are often unable and unwilling to enforce national rules and regulations. Companies and consumers who purchase goods made by children are often unaware that these practices remain unchecked.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Evolution of Ethics</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_s02_p01">Ethics evolves over time. It is difficult for both companies and professionals to operate within one set of accepted standards or guidelines only to see them gradually evolve or change. For example, bribery has been an accepted business practice for centuries in Japan and Korea. When these nations adjusted their practices in order to enter the global system, the questionable practices became illegal. Hence a Korean businessman who engaged in bribery ten or twenty years ago may not do so today without finding himself on the other side of the law. Even in the United States, discrimination and business-regulation laws have changed tremendously over the last several decades. And who can know what the future holds? Some of the business practices that are commonly accepted today may be frowned on tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-168388-ch04_s04_s03_s02_p02">It’s clear that changing values, as influenced by global media, and changing perceptions and cultures will impact global ethics. The most challenging aspect is that global business does not have a single definition of “fair” or “ethical.” While culture influences the definitions of those ideas, many companies are forced to navigate this sensitive area very carefully, as it impacts both their bottom line and their reputations.</p>
